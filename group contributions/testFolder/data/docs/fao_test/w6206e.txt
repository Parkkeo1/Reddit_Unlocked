<title>Women's participation in national forest programmes</title>
<section>1</section>
Introduction
National forest programmes provide a global framework for addressing forestry issues within the context of sustainable development. This concept of sustainability, one of the major challenges for the future of humanity, has been widely discussed during recent United Nations international conferences (UNCED, Rio 1992; Nutrition, Rome 1992; Population, Cairo 1993; Social Development, Copenhagen 1994; Women, Beijing 1995; Food Security, Rome 1996) and in other international and national fora. Regarding forests, sustainability is closely related to a rational, efficient and fair exploitation of natural resources, for the benefit of present and future generations.
In order to meet the imperatives of sustainability, efficiency and equality activities related to forests, particularly those carried out in the framework of national forest programmes, have increasingly put the accent on a series of principles guiding the planning, development and implementation of forest programmes and plans. Among these, partnership between all interest groups and the participation of all actors in forestry processes occupy a leading position.
It has been shown that the success of national forest programmes is heavily dependent on the creation of a context that favours the involvement of all parties, actors and partners concerned to ensure participatory planning and decision-making. In fact, by creating real participation of the range of actors concerned, all groups and individuals will be able to offer a direct or indirect contribution to programmes and their efficiency will improve.
Nevertheless, the widening of participation to all stakeholders - rural men and women, NGOs, local organisations, women's groups, the private sector, government, university circles - calls for certain mechanisms and conditions. It can only come about if there is a free exchange of information, open dialogue and the possibility for debate.
In this context, a fundamental characteristic of the participatory process is the availability of the most detailed information possible. This is the base element for the forest planning process. One can see the importance of calling on participatory planning tools capable of revealing various types of information (social, technical, economic and environmental), and this draws attention to another basic principle of forest programmes: multi-disciplinarity.
The reference document entitled 'Basic Principles and Operational Guidelines for National Forest Programmes' (FAO, 1996) stresses that in many cases particular attention should be given to the participation of local and regional level organisations, women and local communities and populations. Further, this document notes that:
"Women play a vital role in many aspects of forestry development. Gender issues should be given due consideration throughout the process and specific actions should be identified to facilitate the participation of women as fully integrated partners in all phases (planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation) of the process."
Other important social characteristics which need to be taken into account during planning and development include ethnicity, caste, socio-economic level, age and occupation. However, gender deserves special attention since it cuts across all sectors and organisational levels of society, from micro to macro level. Regardless of class or race, women and men have roles, responsibilities, resources, constraints and opportunities which differ according to gender.
It is therefore important for the planner to raise a series of questions such as:
o What development objectives will address the needs and priorities of the women and men concerned?
o Who will be directly involved in the planning and implementation of each activity women, men, or both?
o What resources do the women and men involved need to have to contribute to development activities?
o What constraints block the participation of women, of men?
Answers to such questions help improve planning because facts concerning the participants are available: who they are; what they do; where or how they live; how they perceive their needs, their constraints and their possibilities.
This Technical Note aims to present a concrete and systematic mechanism through which gender considerations can be taken fully into account during the planning, implementation and review of national forest programmes. It highlights the importance of taking the female dimension into account in such programmes in order to strengthen the success of forest planning and development activities. The approach recommended for this integration in planning is firmly centred on participation.
The first section of this document provides a rapid overview of "gender specificities", of the roles, responsibilities, needs, constraints and opportunities which can be specific to men and to women, in particular in forestry. Also outlined are the reasons explaining why these gender considerations should be taken into account in programmes and projects.
The second section is a step-by-step review of the different phases of the formulation of national forest programmes, as described in the reference document: 'National Forest Programmes. Basic Principles and Operational Guidelines' (FAO, 1996). This section should be read in the light of integrating gender in processes and programmes. Also briefly outlined are the participatory tools which can be used in each phase of the various processes to build up an appropriate data base on what men and women do and why.
As with other technical notes published by FAO (for example, on watershed management, nutrition or ecoturism-tourism), this document is intended to help planners and decision-makers improve planning in the forest and forestry sectors, by integrating considerations based on gender. It is also meant to enable anyone interested to better understand the multi-disciplinary aspects of forest planning.

Legislation
Representation and decision-making
Today, the international forestry community fully recognises that women and men play different roles in forestry and forestry-related activities. Case studies conducted in all parts of the world confirm that rural women and men fulfil significant, but distinct, functions in natural resource use and management. The tasks they perform, the way they earn a living and allocate their time, the way they use forest and tree resources, the control they have over resources are among the factors that can vary enormously.
These differences can also be found at the level of constraints, barriers and opportunities. Further, these variations exist not only between cultures, but also within cultures, communities and families. As male migration and female poverty increase, these differences will have an ever-growing impact.
Migration and Poverty
The important phenomenon of the rural exodus of men in search of paid employment means that households are increasingly headed by women. They struggle with difficulties that only serve to further accentuate their poverty, and they find themselves forced to make choices in the absence of male labour.
Today, of the estimated 1.3 billion people living in poverty, more than 70% are women. The number of rural women living in absolute poverty has risen by almost 50% over the past two decades. Increasingly, poverty has a woman's face (2).
The following sections look at the differences, points in common and complementarities that can often be found between men and women in the forest sector. Far from being exhaustive, this list is intended solely as a rapid overview of the differences and complementarities between men and women in the various spheres of the forest sector, differences that cannot be ignored in planning.
Natural resources
The document entitled 'Integrating Gender Considerations into FAO Forestry Projects' (FAO, 1993) outlines the basic differences between men and women concerning activities connected with trees and forests:
o land tenure laws, both customary and statutory, may be different for men and women;
o some women may retain exclusive rights to certain parts of a tree (leaves, branches, fruit), while the tree itself may be "owned" by a man;
o women may choose one crop over another to avoid the need for male labour during land clearing;
o men and women may make different decisions about the use and sale of forest products;
o women and men may prefer different tree species based on the tasks they fulfil.
It is important to recognise that, even though women are often at a disadvantage to men when it comes to access to natural resources, this access varies enormously from context to context and it is impossible to generalise.
On the other hand, it is clear that deforestation affects women in particular since they are primarily responsible for collecting firewood, water and numerous forest products. Having to travel longer distances for gathering and employing more time and energy to find water and fetch wood has a negative impact on other activities they could undertake to earn income or simply have free time.
Work
The work of men and women in society often has three dimensions:
1) in relation to reproduction, above all child-bearing, the education of children, household tasks (including fetching water and firewood), as well as tasks related to the maintenance and sustainability of the work force. This aspect generally concerns women, even if men participate to a much lesser extent;
2) in relation to production in exchange for monetary or in-kind retribution; this aspect falls within the competence of both men and women;
3) in relation to community, voluntary and unpaid activities that contribute to social cohesion (holidays, traditions, etc.). This aspect is primarily the responsibility of women.
With regard to productive labour in developing countries, women constitute an important segment of the work-force in forest and forest-related activities: they work in tree nurseries, plantations, harvesting, processing, sale of wood, etc. What differentiates men and women above all is the fact that much of women's work "remains unrecognised and unvalued. This has an impact on the status of women in society, their opportunities in public life and the gender-blindness of development policy. (...) Women's work is greatly undervalued in economic terms". (2)
Credit and technology
As emphasised in the Third Progress Report on the Programme of Action of the World Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development (Rome, 1991), "programmes for granting credit and guaranteeing loans benefit male farmers, while women, who have no land or guarantee, are excluded from these, although it is recognised that they are less likely to default on payments...". Men dominate assets and means of production such as land and technology. Subsequently, the enormous potential contribution of women remains underused. (2)
Education, training and extension
Education increases the ability to participate in society and to improve the quality of life and the standard of living. The school enrolment gap between men and women is still very wide.
Extension programmes for women are also limited. As stressed in the UNDP Human Development Report 1995 (2), almost all extension workers are men, even if women constitute the majority of farmers. "In the late 1980s, only 13% of agricultural field agents in the developing world were women - only 7% in Africa and 0,5% in India. Most Indian states do not include female farmers among extension beneficiaries - even though 48% of India's self-employed cultivators in 1983 were women. In Africa, only 69% of female farmers received extension visits, compared with 97% of male farmers."
The same inequality of access exists in training programmes (technical, management, etc.).
Knowledge and conservation of the environment
Even though women are largely excluded from training and extension programmes, it should be noted that they possess a wide range of knowledge about the use and conservation of natural resources. For example, in Sierra Leone, women could name 31 different uses for trees while men could name only eight (4). Men and women possess different knowledge about natural resources and forest genetics. Drawing on the knowledge of one and the other can only enrich programmes.
Men and women often have very different skills and knowledge, which together create a knowledge system specific to local conditions, needs and priorities.
There are basically four elements to gender differences in knowledge systems^1:
o women and men have knowledge about different things;
o men and women have different knowledge about the same things;
o women and men may organise their knowledge in different ways;
o men and women may receive and transmit their knowledge through different means.

Indigenous Knowledge Systems: Implications for Agricultural and International Development. Studies in Technologies and Social Change Series, no. 11., Iowa State University. 1993.
Contribution to food security^2
^2 Refer to "Considering Nutrition in National Forestry Programmes" (FAO, 1996) for more details on the benefits from trees and forests regarding food security.
Forest and tree products can make direct contributions to household food security and health, mainly for the poorest families and in times of natural disaster or "lean season". Further, the income obtained though the sale of certain products (fuelwood, medicines) can then be used to purchase food. It is worth noting that men and women usually spend their incomes differently. For example, a study conducted in Burkina Faso indicated that men spend 33% of their income on food and family needs while women spend 84% of their income on the family (Commission of the European Communities, 1991; quoted in (3)).
Legislation
Legal parameters such as land and tree property rights can vary enormously, but usually to the detriment of women. At the same time, family and community norms, traditions and religious beliefs are other factors that often have a discriminatory impact on women's access to and control of resources and benefits.
"In many parts of the developing world, women do not have legal control over the land they farm. (...) In Africa, where women constitute 80% of food producers, past policies have undermined their traditional land rights" (2).
In 'Development Policy and Strategy for the Benefit of Rural Women' (5), it is noted that at the juridical level, the most crucial element "concerns land, its ownership, access and use. Rural women are often excluded from owning this primary production factor through either inheritance systems or land tenure regulations. (...) The criterion for being awarded land (...) is status as family head. Although rural women often fulfil. this function in the absence of men (through migration, death or divorce), they are still not eligible to hold land since the law does not recognise their status as family head."
The lack of land tenure security has important repercussions on productivity (why invest if there is no guarantee of use?), on sustainability (why use techniques that favour the sustainability of resources?) and on access to certain services (such as credit).
Representation and decision-making
In most cultures, women are excluded from leadership and decision-making roles which determine development activities. Women do not share fully in decision-making processes at household, village or national levels. Their representation in political parties, public institutions and people's organisations has not been sufficient to ensure they benefit fully from the development of their communities and nations. Some progress has been made through access to local groups and organisations, but a wider acceptance of their capabilities is required at all levels of policy-making (12).
Being less represented than men in associations and other organised groups, women have less opportunities to speak out. This is important because organised groups increase the visibility and the involvement of persons in the decision-making processes regarding the actions affecting them. "Organised groups also help women to overcome their reluctance to speak out, act or intervene on their own. This factor is particularly significant when it comes to obtaining credit, machinery, tools, land and access to services. Groups are also excellent structures for all types of training..." (5).
This rapid overview of the differences and complementarities between men and women in the rural and forest sector demonstrates the existence of clear disparities in roles, responsibilities, possibilities and constraints between the female and male population, often to the detriment of women.
In fact, the differences and contrasts to be found in everyday life are the fruit of an historical imbalance which was reflected in many years of development projects. It was not recognised until the 1970s, thanks to the work of Ester Boserup ('Women's Role in Economic Development'), that development has different repercussions on men and women.
It was then that the idea that development could not be considered a neutral process regarding gender equality began gaining ground. But Boserup's work went even further: of all development projects, many not only did not take into account women but even reduced their autonomy and their opportunities in the economic sector.
This calls into question the traditional model of development. Today, it is accepted that individuals - men and women - should be at the centre of all development processes. In this sense, the development paradigm based on the individual would have little sense if the question of gender equality was not taken into serious consideration.
The forest sector is not excluded from this necessity, and planners and those responsible for designing policies cannot ignore this aspect of planning. The success of sustainable development and the achievement of greater equality necessarily depends on taking into account actors ignored in the past and ensuring their participation, whether they be women or marginalised sectors (ethnic or poor groups, etc.).
It is now recognised that planning is doomed to failure if it does not consider the needs, priorities and constraints of the target population. As a result, it is essential to look at the specificities of men and women, and to collect gender-specific data that can add to the development planning process.

Men and women in national forest programmes
Approach, goal and objectives, principles of the national forest programmes
This second section is designed as a "re-reading" of the reference document for national forest programmes, entitled 'Basic Principles and Operational Guidelines' in the context of understanding the implications of the involvement and participation of women and men in forest development activities.
Approach, goal and objectives, principles of the national forest programmes
Approach
"National forest programmes follow a participatory planning and implementation approach that encourages the involvement of all forest-dependent actors..." (8; p.13)
which implies that actors should not be considered "asexual", but comprise both women and men.
"National forest programmes provide a environment for the concerted and co-ordinated implementation of programmes and activities by all stakeholders..." (8; p. 13)
which implies that the stakes and interests of actors or groups in question be seen, understood and analysed in the context of the differences and complementarities between men and women. This is the only way that programmes and activities can take place on the basis of a real consensus between institutions and populations, men and women.
Goal and Objectives
"The goal of national forest programmes is to promote the conservation and sustainable use of forest resources to meet local, national and global needs, through fostering national and international partnerships to manage, protect and restore forest resources and land, for the benefit of present and future generations.
The main objectives are to:
o introduce inter-sectoral planning approaches involving all relevant partners;
o raise awareness and mobilise commitments at all levels in order to address the issues related to sustainable forestry development;
o increase the efficiency and effectiveness of both public and private actions for sustainable forestry development;
o foster local, national, regional and international partnerships;
o mobilise and organise national and (if necessary) international resources and catalyse action to implement programmes/plans in a co-ordinated manner;
o plan and implement how forests and the forestry sector could contribute to national and global initiatives." (8; p.14)
Close attention to gender issues permits one to understand that anything to do with the process of national forest programmes must reflect the needs and capacities of men and women. Forest development activities must therefore be tailored to the perceived needs of the different groups involved, men and women. Further, all potential partners representing either the interests of women or men should be informed of the opportunities related to forest development and conservation of the environment.
Principles
The basic principles of national forest programmes involve all actors in a process of partnership and participation, as well as in an inter-sectoral and iterative global process. The stress is also placed on development and support for the ability of human resources so that institutions and the mechanisms of which they are carriers, as well as their strategies, guarantee coherence between goals, programmes and national planning.
Respect for these principles assumes that particular attention be given:
o to the methodological level in order that the dynamics of partnership and participation involve all the actors concerned in the conservation and development of forest resources. These actors may be institutions and (public or private) bodies responsible for forest affairs, but also social and economic issues; specialists of either sex who are competent in the forest sector, but also sensitive to the human dimension of the question; men and women directly involved day-to-day in the use, management and conservation of natural resources.
o to the human level in order to reinforce capacities aimed at, on the one hand the technical and the human dimension of forest development, on the other facilitating the access of women as well as men to education and training for the promotion of an increased accountability of all actors.
o to the institutional level in order that the sectors responsible for national forest programmes benefit from an organisation that permits them to develop mechanisms for implementation and follow-up/evaluation, as well as parallel measures (reform, legislation) that reflect the view that sustainable forest development also depends on taking into account the day-today realities of men and women.

How to consider gender in national forest programmes^3
Phase 1: Organization of the process
Phase 2: Strategic planning
Phase 3: Implementation
Phase 4: Revision and updating
^3 The phases suggested correspond to the ones described de distintas in the reference document "Basic Principles and Operational Guidelines. Formulation, Implementation and Revision of the National Forest Programmes" (FAO, 1996).
This section provides a broad overview of the different stages of planning, implementation and review of national forest programmes. For each phase, it offers guidelines for ways of integrating gender considerations in all activities. It also recommends tools which will facilitate the gathering of social, technical, economic and environmental information to be used in planning and in each phase of the process. Tables giving an overview of what can be done and how it can be done are included for each phase.
This technical note should be used together with the publication 'Enhancing People's Participation in National Forest Programmes' (11). It provides valuable guidelines for facilitating participation and stimulating the participatory collection and analysis of information.
The process followed by national forest programmes can be broken down into four main phases:
Phase 1: Organization of the Process
Phase 2: Strategic Planning
Phase 3: Implementation
Phase 4: Revision and Updating
Phase 1: Organization of the process
This logistical phase comprises three steps:
1) Identification of Partners
"Women play a vital role in many aspects of forestry activities. Collectively they are one of the main actors on the forestry scene. Their participation in the process should thus be fully recognised and facilitated" (drawn from National Forest Programmes. Basic Principles and Operational Guidelines, FAO, 1996, page 30, point on identification of partners).
It might be noted that the low participation of women as partners in the planning process is often due to the ignorance of planners concerning the gender issue. It is absolutely necessary that in the identification of partners consideration be given to bringing together networks and organisations that have an understanding of gender issues. The course of action could be the following:
o identification of competent partners, i.e. networks and organisations whose functions, responsibilities and activities are oriented toward taking into account gender-related considerations;
o making contact at the local level with women's groups and organisations, as well as with NGOs and/or organisations representing women's interests, and
o making contact at the institutional level with national structures, both public and private, responsible for issues related to the integration of women (ministries, special offices, etc.).
Another important aspect to bear in mind in identifying partners is the establishment of technical, social and economic criteria, which must make explicit reference to the need to be representative of society, which is made up of men and women.
2) Organization of National Coordination Mechanisms
In order that due consideration is given to gender issues, two aspects are fundamental: i) the composition of the authorities; ii) their mandates.
i) Representatives sensitive to gender issues must work together with the coordination authorities. These could be individuals, groups (NGOs, associations) or institutions (women's or other ministries). In this context, the way in which partners have been identified (giving full priority to the importance of partners who are competent in the integration of women) is crucial, given that society still relegates women to a marginal position in terms of representation, participation and decision-making.
ii) It is also necessary to pay major attention (in the case of the National Coordination Unit) to the mandate given to the structures responsible for coordination, management and monitoring of the planning process. This mandate must explicitly refer to recognition of gender issues. Further, the national coordinator chosen must be sensitive to male and female roles and, if possible, have received training in this sector.
These examples illustrate the type of recommendations to include in the mandates of such organisms. The operational guidelines for national forest programmes describe how the role of the National Forest Consultative Group is, above all, to "promote consensus on critical issues related to forest development and conservation". One might add that this group should be vigilant to the point that the opinions of women, and not only of men, be included in the search for this consensus. Another task of the group is to "periodically review the progress of related policy and institutional reforms". One could finish the phrase, saying that policy analysis must foresee the study of the impact of current and reformed policies on men and on women.
3) Development of a Communication Strategy
The communication strategy to choose is dependent on different interest groups, their motivations, their capacity of access to information and the means of communication used.
From the very outset, the content must reflect information related to gender issues, and means of communication must be used that reach women as well as men (for example, taking into account radio listening times, day and hour of meetings, use of images rather than words).

<section>5</section>
Phase 2: Strategic planning
This phase gives a better understanding of the main forestry issues by locating them in the context of national development.
It includes different activities:
1) preliminary analysis (review of the current situation, identification of major problems, immediate actions);
2) in-depth sector analysis (specific studies, options);
3) strategic analysis (development and analysis of scenarios, selecting a scenario), and
4) formulation of the sustainable forestry development programme.
To ensure the success of this fundamental phase, precise terms of reference must be drawn up for all partners involved. The mandate should stress the prime importance of role differences between men and women. It should envisage the participation of individuals and interest groups, as well as experts and consultants, drawn from different backgrounds to guarantee that all social, political, economic and environmental aspects are effectively covered.
The persons responsible for the structures chosen to guide and co-ordinate the planning process must be sensitive to the gender issues (for example, through training in gender analysis) and convinced of the absolute priority of integrating the female dimension in forest programmes. The other partners must also be aware of the importance of these issues (for example, through workshops, see box below).
To encourage the participation of all the partners identified, use should be made of a wide range of participatory methods and techniques (for example, the Participatory Rural Appraisal - PRA, the Rapid Rural Appraisal - PRA, etc.), as well as the Socioeconomic and Gender Analysis (SEAGA). Thanks to such techniques, it is possible to systematically identify and analyse all issues taking into account the gender dimension and involving institutions, organisations and individuals. It is important to take advantage of local technical know-how, identify available resources and collect all types of gender-differentiated information.
Many documents have been written on gender issues in development in general and in forestry in particular. Reading these documents could be extremely useful. The box below contains a non-exhaustive list of international organisations concerned specifically with the integration of women,
Workshop on the female dimension in the Central American Forest Programme
In 1992 the Consejo Consultativo Mujer y Desarrollo (Consultative Council on Women and Development), in collaboration with the regional Central American Forest Programme and the Nicaragua Forest Programme, and with the assistance of several international donor agencies, organised the first regional workshop on 'Gender Considerations in Forestry Development Projects'. The workshop brought together representatives from NGOs, governments, donors and the Sub-Regional Steering Committee of the Central American Forest Programme. The workshop led to a series of resolutions which include:
o provision of training for forestry planners in the importance of gender considerations and in the use of socio-economic gender analysis.
o collection of information and development of :case studies on gender issues in the forestry sector in Central America.
o creation of a monitoring and advisory panel on gender issues and policy development to work with the Sub-Regional Steering Committee.

1) Preliminary Analysis
This analysis is usually co-ordinated by the National Coordinating Unit and executed by a small multi-disciplinary team that collects and processes the information. The mandate of each single member should explicitly state that the analysis must take into account gender-specific considerations. It is particularly important as this phase leads to the identification of the major forestry problems that will subsequently be dealt with in forest programmes.
Ideally, all analysis should be based on quantitative and qualitative information distinguishing men and women. Gender-differentiated studies are not always easily found, either because they simply do not exist or because of bad inter-sectoral communication. For example, studies of women may have been carried out by an NGO or by a governmental body but their results not published. One should therefore pay attention to all sources of information, in particular that which shows a special interest in men-women issues. It is therefore useful to join up with other sectors (for example, the office or ministry responsible for women) in the early days of the analysis. This would permit the retrieval of useful information and also help establish a healthy spirit of cooperation.
In the review of the current situation, the themes to consider from a gender perspective include:
o the demographic situation in forest areas
o the health and economic conditions of the people living in these areas
o the ownership and control of resources (legislation, customary rights, agrarian policies, use of resources, etc.)
o production modes and infrastructures (markets, extension, transport, commercial potential, etc.)
o forms of popular organisation (NGO, association)
o services and access to services (education, training, health, credit, etc.)
o local knowledge and practices. (11)
Special emphasis will be placed on questions to do with "the way in which (forest resources) are managed, who owns them, how and to what extent they are used and by whom" (8; p.35).
In fact, these fundamental questions for the evaluation of the status of forest resources can only have reliable answers if aspects related to access to resources and benefits, their ownership and their management and control differentiate the place, role and status of women as well as men.
The review of the current situation leads to the identification of the major problems in this sector, which is decisive for the rest of the process. In putting together teams responsible for this aspect, it is worth calling on people who are competent in gender issues. Problems such as the need for legislative reform or the social functions of forests must be addressed in the context of gender.
Finally, analysis and evaluation can identify the need for immediate action to reinforce capacities, reform policies, laws and institutions or other sectors. In this respect, training in gender issues is probably indispensable at the institutional level,
Participatory methods and national forest programmes
By using participatory methods such as Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) or the Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) it becomes possible to:
o ensure successful participatory planning
o stimulate debate-between the men and women concerned on forestry-related needs, options and constraints
o facilitate decentralised planning, decision-making and follow-up o identify and analyse critical gender issues
o prepare strategic plans
o involve institutions, agencies, organisations and individuals
o tap indigenous technical knowledge
o identify available human and financial resources
o collect gender-differentiated information
2) In-Depth Sector Analysis
A number of critical points and sectors may call for further analysis through specific studies. Normally, it is the National Coordination Unit which is responsible for the supervision of these studies. They call for making maximum use of participatory research and diagnostic techniques to harness the points of view of peoples, institutions, etc. Further, these participatory techniques offer the possibility of collecting gender-differentiated information from a wide range of actors. This ensures respect for the basic principle of forestry programmes, namely participation.
Gender-related considerations must be confronted in a systematic fashion in all specific studies, and this should be explicitly referred to in the terms of reference of these studies. In most cases, a special study of the gender issue in the forest sector can be extremely useful. It can serve as a basic reference document for subsequent discussion, for example in workshops. This special study can also serve to sensitize decision-makers and planners to the gender issue.
Given the role of women in many of the sectors in question, special attention should be given to themes and issues such as:
o evaluation of forest resources: it is important to consider all forest-related activities (craftwork, firewood, collection of food in periods of crisis or "lean season", pharmaceutical products, complementary income, etc.);
o ownership and use: this is an aspect that determines the way resources are managed and thus affects the sustainability of development. Ownership and use have an impact on investment, extraction methods, practices of utilisation and behaviour patterns that promote the protection, conservation and renewal of natural resources.
o biodiversity: women hold the key to many agricultural systems related to food and livelihood security through their roles in the selection and use of plants and trees, and in the conservation and reproduction of biological diversity. They have valuable knowledge regarding local species and ecosystems. Women have specialised knowledge of the value and diverse uses of wild species and varieties that can serve as food in times of shortage (leaves, fruit, berries, nuts, roots, etc.) or that can meet health needs.^4
^4 Based on the document Women - users, preservers and managers of agro-biodiversity', Dossier, Women - The Key to Food Security, Women and Population Division, FAO, 1996.
Thanks to specific studies, it is possible to better understand the problems and therefore envisage different types of response. At the point of identifying options, one should be particularly careful to foresee the impact of whichever solution is proposed, whether for women or men.
3) Strategic Analysis
This phase includes the design and analysis of scenarios that envisage different development alternatives for the sector. Each alternative should be well-documented and include a description of the necessary inputs and expected impact.
For the analysis to be comprehensive, it is necessary to estimate the impact of each planned action on different social groups, and in particular on men and women separately. The Socioeconomic and Gender Analysis (SEAGA) is particularly useful at this stage. Tools for conducting this analysis at the different organisational levels of society (micro, intermediate, macro) can be found in the SEAGA handbooks (in preparation). It is crucial to understand the extent to which reforms (of policy, legislation, institutions) will have an impact on different groups of the population (and thus on men and on women).
For example, in order to facilitate the access of people to economic opportunities in the forestry sector, a number of possible alternatives exist in terms of credit policy. One possibility could be to develop a credit policy to increase lending for small enterprises, but which does nothing to mitigate conditions that constrain women from having access to credit. Another option could be to opt for a credit policy targeted at women (favouring activities and resources which women are likely to control or benefit from, leaving the existing division of resources and responsibilities intact). A third option could be to choose a credit policy targeted at women, accompanied by changes in legislation giving women rights to property and control over household resources. Obviously, the scope and impact of new policies can have very different consequences.^5
^5 Example based on Macro Handbook of SEAGA, Draft FAO, Rome 1997
Participation in workshops, seminars, national and/or international consultations is an opportunity for all partners to offer comments and observations regarding scenarios. This implies involving representatives of governments, institutions, private enterprise, NGOs, associations and indigenous groups, not to mention women's groupings. Special techniques may be necessary to encourage the active participation of groups that are normally marginalised (indigenous and women's groups, for example).
After this analysis of scenarios effected in various types of meetings, it is necessary to move on to the selection of a scenario, taking into account different determinant criteria such as sustainable development, effectiveness and equity.
4) Formulation of the Sustainable Forestry Development Programme
The final stage of the strategic planning phase calls for the formulation of a) a forest policy statement; b) a strategy; c) an action plan.
a) The forest policy statement sets out the framework within which all forest activities of a country must be carried out. It must be consistent with the National Development Plan and thus with the most global macro-economic realities that influence the use, conservation and management of forest resources, as well as with the national declaration on women. It must also be in line with all national policies, including those in favour of women or disadvantaged sectors. Contact should be made with the Ministry of Women's Affairs or the office responsible for women's affairs with a view to collecting information and ensuring that forest policy is coherent with these other policies. The national action plan of a country drawn up for the Beijing Conference on Women (1995) could also be useful.
b) The strategy outlines in concrete terms how, when and by whom the objectives of the forest policy will be achieved. The fields of priority action are also established (for example, institutional reform). In the light of the local situation and needs, one could opt for the integration of the gender dimension in all planned strategies or for the development of a special strategy in favour of women.
However, there is still the question of whether it is preferable to i) integrate women as equal partners with the other beneficiaries of integrated projects, ii) include a "women's component" in all strategies, or iii) adopt a specific women's strategy. There are no easy or generic answers to this type of question. Each individual case has conditions to be respected and dangers to be avoided. However, no matter which type of strategy is chosen, it is essential:
o to favour the appearance of women on the economic and social scene;
o to create a dialogue between men and women within existing social structures.
i) One could choose to integrate women in the strategy, but to do nothing specific for them, in order not to marginalize them. This solution could be the fairest as women and men are considered as equal. However, it does not take into account the barriers encountered by women who usually have a heavier workload than men and have other constraints related to their low schooling rate, absence of training, lack of the habit of participating, etc. Ignoring these obstacles can often leave women on the sidelines, even though the aim is to involve all social actors. It is therefore essential that women be explicitly identified as beneficiaries in any strategy. At the same time, it is important to remember that women do not constitute a homogeneous group: they differ not only socially but also by age, marital status, religion, etc., all factors to be taken into account. It is also important to recognise local conditions (status, roles, etc. of women and men) and to evaluate the
impact of strategies on women's living conditions (developing indicators to measure results).
ii) Strategies with a "women's component": they could include a specialised service for women's activities from the outset or which could subsequently be grafted on to the strategy if the need arises. The conditions for the successful integration of women are the same as those presented in the preceding paragraph. This type of "women's component" runs the risk of paying insufficient attention to the economic role of women, limiting itself to their social role.
iii) Specific women's strategies: these respond to women's real and felt needs in their own fields of activity. The beneficiaries can often be women who belong to already existing women's groups or who become members of groups specifically set up for the purposes of the project. On the one hand, the outcome could be positive since women would be able to acquire decision-making and negotiating capacities, but on the other negative since these capacities may not be recognised in a global and social context. In this sense, certain conflicts between men's and women's interests regarding forest resources are not confronted and remain on the table^6.
^6 This section on the different strategies is drawn from "The Position of women in Rural Development Projects. The Agricultural Intensification Project in Gikongoro, Rwanda", by Odile Verny, FAO, Rome, 1993.
c) The Action Plan spells out the activities necessary for the implementation of the strategy. It includes reforms to be implemented (credit, legislation, etc.) and programmes to realise (reforestation, social forestry, etc.). It should also clearly deal with the issue of capacity building.
Special attention should be put on the following:
o the need for training in gender, in the framework of national capacity building;
o the involvement of partners representing women's interests;
o the design of reforms (laws, institutions, etc.) and the setting up of mechanisms to ensure equal access to resources;
o the impact of the plan on women and men in the social, economic and environmental spheres.
Finally, it is important that the forest development programme resulting from this phase^7:
o increases the participation of women in decision-making regarding the management of local forest resources.
o strengthens the bodies responsible for forestry so that they can effectively support rural women and men in the planning and management of forestry activities.
o develops an appreciation for socio-economic and gender analysis, participatory planning methods and inter-sectoral cooperation within bodies responsible for forestry.
o envisages the review of curricula in forestry training institutions and develops practical field-level training and extension materials.
o provides opportunities for the training of women in technical skills concerned with forestry.
o develops policy incentives to ensure that all tenural arrangements in forestry activities aim to provide women the same access as men to land and/or tree resources.
o promotes information exchange with other groups and institutions using similar approaches at national and international level, as well as creating group networks.

The following table presents the different stages in strategic planning in the context of gender-specific considerations.
Gender Considerations in Strategic Planning
Stage
What
How
Preliminary analysis
a) review of the current situation
a) Existing (secondary) data on the status of resources (who owns them, uses them, takes decisions about their management, etc.). Gender-differentiated data are particularly useful and necessary. Review legislation, policy instruments, practices, policies, institutions, etc. in a gender perspective. Review national capacities: what is the expertise in gender issues?
Contact ministries responsible for women's issues as well as those concerned by gender issues (planning, agriculture, economy, etc.) Contact NGOs, which are often organised in federations and have "women and development" working groups. It is worth noting that many countries have an inter-ministerial "women and development" network co-ordinated by the ministry responsible for women and a multilateral inter-agency committee.
b) identification of major problems
b) Need for reforms of policies, laws, institutions; potential of forest resources; conservation needs; social functions of forests, impact of extraction, etc. All aspects should be covered taking gender issues into account.
National accounting (data on economic the contribution of forests, etc.)
Information management system (studies, surveys, statistics): household surveys, use of women's/men's time, resources.
Undertake the Socio-economic and Gender Analysis (use SEAGA handbooks for macro, intermediate, and field levels).
c) immediate actions
c) Immediate actions: capacity building in gender issues, reforms, urgent action.
The participatory tools as RA and PRA are useful in the multi-partner identification of problems. Continue
In-depth sector analysis
a) specific studies
a) precise diagnosis of the major problems in the light of gender considerations.
Involvement of all actors in the diagnosis, analysis and search for solutions. Eventual use can be made of existing participatory techniques and tools (PRA, RA, PRA, etc.).The SEAGA Field Handbook can be extremely useful.
b) options
b) possible solutions and their differentiated impact on men and women.
Strategic analysis
a) design and analysis of scenarios
a) for the range of forest development alternatives: expected impact on men and women; analysis of the human resources (men and women); etc.
National and international consult-a/ions, roundtables, workshops: it is important to programme the participation of gender experts and women in the working teams.
b) choice of a scenario
b) choice also based on gender considerations.
All the tools connected with strategic analysis (definition of scenarios, cost-efficiency analysis, etc.) will contain a gender dimension.
SEAGA is particularly useful (a premium is placed on participatory methods).
Formulation of the national forest programme
a) Forest Policy Statement
a) harmonisation with the national development plan and taking into account the National Women's Declaration.
Participation of the ministry or office responsible for women's affairs; other ministries and public structures with a view to studying sectoral strategies having aspects related to gender.
b) Long-term Strategy
b) development of strategies with a "women's component" or a specific strategy in favour of women, or a "unique" gender based strategy.
c) Action Plan
c) aspects related to training, participation and impact.
What is the Socio-Economic and Gender Analysis?
The Socio-Economic and Gender Analysis (SEAGA) is an approach to development based on an analysis of socio-economic patterns and participatory identification of women's and men's priorities and opportunities.
"Socio-economic analysis" refers to the study of the environmental, economic, social and institutional patterns that form the context of development, as well as the interaction between these factors. "Gender analysis" refers to the study of the different social roles of women and men with a view to understand better what they do, what resources they possess and their needs and priorities.
The marriage between "socio-economic analysis" and "gender analysis" permits a realistic look at the development challenge - taking into account socio-economic factors at different levels of social organisation and from the points of view of different people.
The analysis covers three levels: the macro level (national and international institutions, policies and programmes), the intermediate level (institutions and services that serve as intermediaries between the macro and field levels), the micro (field) level (households and individuals).
FAO's SEAGA Programme provides methodologies and participatory tools for analysis (handbooks will be soon available for each level) and develops training materials in socioeconomic and gender analysis which can be easily adapted to all types of situation.

Phase 3: Implementation
The implementation of a national forest programme has four elements: 1) Coordination and monitoring of implementation; 2) capacity building programme; 3) policy institutional and legal reform; 4) investment programme
1) Coordination and monitoring of implementation
If the composition or mandate of the national authorities approached in the planning phase is modified during implementation, one should be careful to take account of the gender considerations.
Regarding the coordination of implementation, care must be taken to ensure that all participants, particularly those groups generally marginalised such as women, receive information about activities and results achieved. Further, structures set up for the technical coordination of programmes or sub-national coordination must be sensitive to and take into account the challenges of gender in whatever they do. As with all the committees, groups, etc. set up in the framework of national forest programmes, special attention must be paid to the composition and mandate of these structures and, eventually, ensure that their members benefit from gender-oriented training.
Monitoring refers to the overall control of programme implementation concerning process, inputs, results and impact.
For monitoring to be effective, it is a necessary precondition to develop indicators that can measure the results obtained, the impact and effects (in technical, economic, social and environmental terms) on both women and men, and the benefits obtained by the participants.
Participatory methods and approaches are also crucial for the implementation phase, particularly in terms of collecting gender-differentiated information. The participatory tools might include the following:
Participatory Assessment, Monitoring and Evaluation (PAME) should be used to^8:
o give the women and men involved the means to participate actively in the reviewing and revision of the national forest programme;
o further develop the forest programme;
o design activities;
o establish indicators to evaluate the integration of women^9;
o facilitate annual consultations focusing on women in development and gender issues 9;
o determine the impact of the national forest programme on women and men.

^9 Pomerleau, 1989. Women in Development- A Strategic Approach for the Forestry Sector. CIDA Natural Resources Division Forestry Sector pp. 23.
The Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) could be used to:
o prepare operational plans at local level.
The Action Research/ Extension (R&D)^10 could be useful to:
o support the iterative aspect of programmes by continually incorporating new information and solutions during the implementation of national forest programmes;
o encourage women and men involved in the process to take control of activities.
^10 Refer to Hoskins, M., 1994. Supporting Farmer Extension and Research. Forest, Trees and People Newsletter no. 23. Feb. 1994. IRDC, Swedish university of Agricultural Sciences, Sweden.
The Socioeconomic and Gender Analysis (SEAGA) can be used to formulate projects and programmes.
In the course of this phase, use of these methods and tools can provide:^11
o opportunities for policy dialogue between all partners;
o information and promotional material on the goals of the forest programme and the benefits of being involved;
o support to networks, professional associations and groups -particularly those supporting women;
o better and wider distribution of data supporting the economic and social value of women's full participation;
o equal representation of women and men on steering committees, village committees, regional coordinating bodies, etc.;
o resources, such as financial aid, for both women and men;
o accessible credit schemes for new/existing women entrepreneurs to develop and expand their businesses;
o opportunities for research on income generation and technological innovations in support of female entrepreneurship (Pomerleau, 1989).
o support for professional exchanges at local and international level;
o support for the effective use of the private sector, e.g. consulting firms, NGOs, corporations, etc.
^11 Adapted from CIDA, "Guidelines for Integrating WID Project Design and Evaluation". Program Evaluation I Division Policy Branch, Hull, Quebec, Canada, 1986.
2) Capacity Building Programme
Capacity building should include training activities oriented toward sensitizing target publics to gender issues. In addition, training also regards the use of methods and analyses that throw into sharp relief the roles, responsibilities, needs and constraints of men and women, thus permitting better solutions to development realities at the planning and implementation stages.
Capacity building is intended for all partners, from forestry institutions, private and public enterprises through to NGOs and grassroots organisations. It is important that training be effected in relationship to the roles played by different parties involved in the process.
A second element of capacity building concerns women directly as beneficiaries of training activities. As stressed in the reference guide for national forest programmes (8), capacity building will
"result in an improved technical capacity and mechanisms for participation and empowerment."
Here one can see the importance of paying sufficient attention to social groups that have been excluded from decision-making processes and participation, for example indigenous groups and women. Capacity building represents a unique occasion for recognising the potential of such groups. In this sense, it is important to foresee support for the creation or consolidation of associations that can subsequently be put in contact or networked with other similar groupings, thus leading to continuous consolidation of capacities.
The training opportunities^12 offered in the framework of national forest programmes should:
o be "custom-made" for local realities at national level or the regional institutions of countries;
o be locally accessible and conveniently scheduled (e.g. evening courses);
o be short-term;
o offer safe accommodations for both women and men;
o provide childcare facilities,
o be possible on-the-job;
o continually upgrade training material;
o allocate a set percentage of training facilities to women and disadvantaged groups;
o assess local, regional and national needs and trends.
o train local trainers - both women and men.
o be linked to employment practices, career counselling and jobs for women and men;
o be targeted to women's groups to build up their "out-reach" potential.
^12 Adapted from CIDA, "Barriers and Strategies for Overcoming Barriers to Women's Participation in Training and Scholarship Programmes". Hull, Quebec, Canada, page 11.
3) Policy, Institutional and Legal Reform Programme
Modification of laws, policies and institutions should be effected in the light of the results obtained by the strategic planning in the sector. If strategic planning has duly taken into consideration gender issues and highlighted the needs of men and women, reform programmes will inevitably reflect this imperative.
Reform programmes should be discussed among different partners, without forgetting women. All reforms, from those concerning governmental structures and roles through to laws and rules covering the distribution of financial resources, forest use, etc. must take into account aspects related to gender. This is particularly important as many obstacles faced by women are linked to their status of inferiority, which is also reflected in laws, policies and institutions.
The application of new legislation is fundamental. For example, in terms of gender equality of access to land, a government might introduce legislation under which land could be assigned to all citizens over the age of 18, independent of the gender of the claimant. Nevertheless, this could pose practical problems, especially if village councils responsible for land distribution do not accept women's rights. In such a case, it could be necessary to call on the government to intervene directly to ensure respect for the law.
4) Investment Programme
Whether public investment projects implemented by state bodies or publicly or privately financed projects not financed by the state, investment programmes must respect the principle of the full participation of targeted beneficiaries, both women and men.
Direct incentive measures (credit, subsidies, etc.) or indirect measures (training, extension) must be offered to both female and male populations. Numerous problems could occur, particularly in the case of financial incentives offered in the framework of a national mechanism, for example the banking system used as the financing channel. In fact, this could impose conditions (at the level of title deeds as guarantee) that in many countries run the risk of excluding poor households and women. It is often preferable to call on locally-based implementation measures.
Further, decentralised planning and programming is the main approach for promoting forestry development at local level. Here again, all activities must be undertaken in the light of women's as well as men's needs, and taking into account the different obstacles and constraints faced by both. Participatory methods and analysis are central to this approach.
These decentralised activities are particularly important since they permit the identification of local needs (in terms of incentives, capacity building, extension, etc.), as well as being fundamental for studying and understanding the potential impact of policies and legislative reform, provided these include men and women.

participation of target beneficiaries and taking into consideration of the obstacles to access to the benefits of such investment
Phase 4: Revision and updating
The revision and updating of national forest programmes should be considered as a crucial phase of the process, leading to a continuous upgrading of programmes. It is important to have previously established criteria capable of evaluating the results achieved and, eventually, to introduce necessary modifications.
This phase comprises three main steps:
1) Evaluation of implementation
o Which development objectives have addressed the needs and priorities of women and men?
o Who, women, men or both, have been directly involved in the planning and implementation of each activity?
o What constraints have blocked the participation of men, of women, etc.?
Such questions should be posed at the time of evaluation, and all aspects should be viewed in the light of the gender dimension.
2) Re-assessment of the national and international context
The assessment should take into account new national and international realities in so far as they are related to the gender dimension.
3) Updating sustainable forest development programmes
The same gender-sensitive approach should be used in updating and improving programmes.
For many forest programmes, this phase of review and updating represents an ideal moment for including the gender dimension, which has often been "forgotten" at the point of programme design.
<section>7</section>
Check-list: Gender in national forest programmes
The following list can be used to:
1. identify key questions which need to be answered while carrying out each phase in the process of a national forest programme;
2. ensure gender considerations are incorporated into national forest programmes.
This check-list, and the answers given for each phase, is intended as an integral component of the documents prepared for national forest programmes. It can be used by planners to prompt them to utilise gender-incorporating tools in their work and to facilitate a participatory planning process. The list will also be useful for internal and external monitoring agencies to evaluate the extent to which gender issues have been incorporated into the planning and implementation process of forest programmes, and to make recommendations on where more focus is needed.
Problems raised in answering the check-list should be dealt with explicitly throughout the entire implementation of the process.
Support from existing networks
National, regional and international networks can be consulted for more information on gender issues, on training modules, on experts in gender and development, etc.

Conclusion: The importance of considering gender
Taking into account gender in the design, implementation and review of national forest programmes adds value to such programmes. In addition, the use of participatory planning tools and methodologies facilitates the collection of gender-differentiated information on the social, environmental, technical and economic aspects of forestry development. This will render the planning and implementation of forest development programmes more efficient and egalitarian, two points which are essential for the sustainability of development. Among the benefits which derive from integrating gender issues are the following:
Enhanced social and economic impact of forestry development
Sustainable forestry development depends on integrating environmental, technical and economic considerations with social and cultural aspects. The active participation of women and men in gathering information differentiated by gender, and the analysis of this information and the decision-making process, will lead to a more positive social impact (1).
The economic impact of the programme will be reinforced because the possibilities for consolidating and increasing income related to natural resources take into account income-generating activities carried out by both women and men.
Women often have difficulty in fully participating in development activities due to low levels of education and lack of direct representation in community decision-making bodies. Efforts to involve women as both direct participants and beneficiaries can help them gain status within and outside the context of the project (3).
Increasing possibilities for successful action
Forestry planning that takes into account gender-based division of labour and gender-based access to resources and control of resources will result in development initiatives based on more complete information. In addition, it is possible to avoid negative impacts if guarantees exist that the decisions concerning the management of forest resources by the men and women involved reflect how forest resources are used and managed (1).
More efficient use of resources
Taking into account social, environmental, technical and economic considerations will ensure that development activities make better use of often increasingly diminishing resources available.
Involving groups and individuals not normally party to planning and decision-making can often lead to gathering information which might not be gained otherwise, better targeting of a variety of beneficiary groups, and narrowing the gap between rich and poor (3).
Tapping local knowledge
Tapping the respective knowledge of women and men regarding the management and conservation of natural resources and biological diversity increases the possibilities of successful forestry programmes. Thanks to the collection of gender-differentiated data for planning and management, it is possible to guarantee that this invaluable source of local technical knowledge is fully utilised.
Reinforcing institutional capacities
Training of planners, foresters, technicians and extension agents in the use of planning tools, (such as Rapid Rural Appraisal, Participatory Rural Appraisal, Socio-economic and Gender Analysis, etc.) will stimulate a participatory planning process. It will also increase the capacity of individuals and institutions to address social, economic and environmental issues in forestry development. These kinds of training and skills are required by institutions at all levels multilateral, bilateral, NGOs, academic and the private sector.
Recognising and encouraging the role of women as key players in all aspects of forest development is important. Explicit plans need to be made and budgets and resources allocated in order to train women to work at technical and professional forestry levels, in addition to their traditional grassroots involvement. Advocating access for women to scholarships in forest disciplines, and setting targets for women's participation, can ensure gender considerations are taken fully into account (9).
Better planning
Basing planning on a full range of social, economic, technical and environmental issues, rather than concentrating on one single sector (i.e. forests), opens up the opportunity for greater exchange of ideas and approaches between different sectors. By involving women and men in participatory forestry planning inevitably facilitates analysis of the interaction between the forestry sector and other sectors) such as health, nutrition, agriculture, livestocking breeding, water, fisheries, demography, law, education, etc.).
