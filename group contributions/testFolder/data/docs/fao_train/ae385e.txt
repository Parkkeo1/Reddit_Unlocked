Agribusiness Handbooks.
Poultry / Eggs & Poultry Meat.
This publication was prepared by the FAO Investment Centre under the FAO/EBRD cooperation agreement to provide quick technical and economical reference material to EBRD's agribusiness team in sub-sectors where they often work. Focus was given to the Bank's countries of operation in Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, with indicators of technical and economical performance in other regions of the world noted for comparison. The series of handbooks contained in this publication cover specific agribusiness sub-sectors, with information on production and processing techniques, costs and margins, world production, prices and trade trends. Data were collected from a number of official and unofficial sources as indicative information that should be interpreted with caution, and do not imply the expression of any opinion by FAO concerning the economic situation of countries mentioned. (October 1999).
FAO / EBRD Agribusiness Handbooks vol.6 - Poultry/ Eggs & Poultry Meat.
Poultry represents an important and increasing part of human food consumption, be it through poultry meat (25% of global meat consumption) or eggs. Chicken accounts for about 85%1 of all poultry varieties placement world-wide, the 15% remaining being divided mainly between fowls, ducks, pigeons, turkeys, geese and quails. Hen eggs represent 90% of the global eggs primary production. This handbook will therefore focus on (i) broilers for meat production and (ii) laying hen for eggs production. One should clearly differentiate two ways of managing poultry breeding: intensive & extensive breeding. Extensive breeding largely spreads over developing countries where natural native genetic lines are used, while in industrialised countries, poultry production is largely based on genetic science progresses, with sterile hybrids being used for reproduction purpose. This last way maximises the productivity of breeding activities. Success of poultry meat during the past 10 years is mainly due to: · dietetic quality, rich in protein with low fat content, and very digest, · very large choice of products for consumers, including elaborated products which have strongly developed during the past 5 years, · competitive prices, important factor in the competition between different meats.
1- BROILERS FOR MEAT PRODUCTION.
Key production parameters.
· Specialised firms/institutes obtain chicks from hybrid lines selected for specific characteristics such as resistance to diseases, growth curve, adaptation to certain types of feed, etc... Female chicks are systematically killed. Male chicks are sold to breeders. They can be sold vaccinated or not. In the last case, breeders must vaccinate their chicks themselves. Production cycles of about 6 weeks. The quicker the growth is, the lower quality meat is obtained. Therefore, a tuned calculation has to be done to establish the best profitability (costs of breeding vs mature broilers sale's prices). Feed quality, heat regulation, sanitary control and animal density within breeding houses (in average 10 animals/m²) are the most important factors having an impact on growth. After 6 weeks, broilers reach 2 to 3 kg, with an average weight of 2,5 kg. They are then gathered into cages and sold to processors for slaughtering.
Key production costs.
Production costs are very volatile. They depend a lot on the final product desired characteristics (brand-named or low quality chicken), but also on feed prices (mainly grain prices), climatic conditions, and genetic lines used. Therefore, they vary a lot from one region to another. Ref. page # 55.
in European Union, Chicken accounts only for 70% of total poultry meat produced and consumed.
Live broilers sale's prices.

Price ranges may vary significantly, influenced by seasonal patterns, input costs and relative costs of competing meats. If for example red meat courses collapse, poultry meat prices will automatically decreased since on the meat market for consumers, it must stay the cheapest choice, as it is one of major poultry sector strengths.
Average margins for producers.
Margins for broilers producers depend a lot on final product characteristics (low or high quality product - brand-named chicken with more tender flesh and more flavour). Indeed, high quality products have a slower and longer growing period, which means higher production costs since more feed is used, but also other miscellaneous variable costs are slightly increased. The choice for final product characteristics is largely determined by how much consumers are ready to pay for high quality broilers. It is nevertheless possible to draw approximation for the calculation of average margins.

Other relevant information.
In 1999, returns for producers have become more favourable due to ample soybean and corn supplies resulting in low feed prices. Feed costs typically account for 70% of all production costs.
2- CHICKEN SLAUGHTERING AND PROCESSING.
Process description.
The range of finish products depends on · the raw material processed · the degree of processing: - eviscerated broiler (with head and feet) - eviscerated broiler (ready to cook) - carved broiler - deboned broiler meat pieces - prepared meals - cold products (refrigerated with air or water) - frozen products.
the method of preservation:.
A poultry slaughterhouse consists of an aerial conveyor belt, from which the birds hang suspended by the feet. The conveyor belt brings the poultry through certain automatic machines, or in front of manual posts, so as to execute the following operations:.
Reception of living animals from source of breeding.
W eighting of cages.
Hydraulic conveyor belt Slaughtering Anesthesia (optional, depending on ritual) Bleeding Passage through hot water bath Plucking Specific plucker machine.
Hooking the head and feets.
+ optional skinning, depending of the final product to be manufactured.
Livers Hearts Gizzards.
Evisceration (automatic or manual).
cutting of cloaca opening of abdomen extracting of abdominal organs.
Optional Processing.
Slitting of throat interior aspiration with a vacuum pump before final inspection Cooling with air or water W hole broilers ready for packaging Optional carving Read y to be packed carved or deboned broilers' pieces Optional deboning.
Conversion factors from live animals.
The figure commonly used is the carcass yield, which corresponds to carcass weight v.s. weight of the alive animal. This figure varies a lot depending on production conditions - some estimates are given hereafter:.

USA 2.0 2.0.
Russia 1.5 3.3.
Brazil 1.54 2.0.
W orld Average 1.38 kg 2.2.
The genetic potential for broiler production under ideal conditions can be estimated from the claims of the breeding companies. An example is the standard published by Arbor Acres, which claims the following: Liveweight Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) Age at slaughter Index value 2.57 kgs 1.91 (kg feed needed / kg meat produced) 49 days 274.6.
The index is a summary indicator of technical performances. It is calculated as: liveweight x 10,000 Index = ----------------------------------------------feed conversion ratio x days of age.
Key slaughtering and processing costs.
Investment costs for a 4 000 chickens/hour slaughterhouse represent around US$ 2.4 million, including equipment (US$ 1 000 000), surface building (around 1 100 m²) and surface land (around 2 500 m²).

Eastern European countries are characterised by a relatively high cost structure caused by an inadequate bird performance in spite of a rather favourable raw material position. Because the raw materials are perishable, the conception / organisation of the slaughterhouse must be closely adapted to supply conditions (average weight of animals, age, available quantity per week, seasonality of supplies, ...).

A spreading of the global economic contagion to Brazil and the resulting devaluation of the Real in January 1999 is leading to considerable uncertainty about 1999 prospects for the Brazilian poultry industry. Brazil continues nevertheless to be the lowest cost producer of broiler meat in the world, turning out live broilers at a cost of around US$ 0.64/kg, thus allowing Brazil to maintain its position as the world's second largest exporter.

% ('000 tons).
Russian poultry meat output which increased slightly in 1998 due to low feed prices, increased regional government support and higher levels of investment in the industry is expected to jump 13% to 720 000 tons in 1999. Besides government support, Russian financial groups, foreign companies and meat processing plants are making investments in the poultry industry. This recovery in production is expected to dramatically drop Russia's import dependence on imported poultry meat which reached 70 percent in 1997 Output growth of the Mexican poultry industry, the fourth largest in the world, is expected to be constrained in 1999 by high interest rates and the industry's difficulty procuring feed requirements. The Russian crisis, lower WTO subsidised export commitments, an overburdened pork industry, the return of consumer confidence in beef meat and increasing government pressure for more stringent environmental regulations are setting the stage for a slowdown in EU poultry meat production in 1999. Concern about waning export opportunities in 1999 has for example prompted the French and the Dutch industries to limit chicken placements and increase the time between production cycles. Asia is already the leading area in terms of the number of birds killed, but the average weight at slaughter is considerable below that in North/Central America.

After experiencing double-digit export gains over the past decade, poultry meat exports in 1998 registered an unprecedented decline as the financial crisis in Russia put the brakes on the growth in world poultry meat trade in mid-year. The pervasiveness of the economic crisis in Russia is expected to generate a decline in overall poultry meat imports by selected countries in 1999 to 4.4 million tons. In Eastern European Countries, poultry meat consumption per capita should keep growing quickly, while production curve should follow more slowly: quantities available for export should thus decrease globally. Hungary will remain by far the most important exporter within the region. While continuing to be the world's major poultry meat supplier, U.S. exports are expected to drop, benefiting to changing competitive position of major poultry meat exporters due to currency devaluations, such as Brazil and some Asian countries. China's role in the poultry meat export market is being increasingly challenged by the wave of competitor currency devaluations and product quality concerns. While China continued to be Japan's (the world's fourth largest poultry import market) major poultry meat supplier in 1998, strong competition from Thailand and Brazil arose. The strong export growth enjoyed by the EU poultry meat industry over the past few years came to a halt in 1998. The devaluation of the Brazilian currency in expected to generate extreme price competition in the Middle East for French whole birds, especially in the context of declining subsidised export limits.

3- LAYING HEN BREEDING FOR EGGS PRODUCTION.
Key production parameters.
· Specialised firm/institutes obtain chicks from hybrid lines selected for specific characteristics such as yearly number of eggs laid, eggs size, adaptation to certain types of feed, etc... Male chicks are systematically killed. Female chicks are sold to breeders. They can be sold vaccinated or not. In the last case, breeders must vaccinate themselves their chicks. During the two first weeks of growth there are no differences with male chicks grown to become broilers. Feed quality, heat regulation, sanitary control and animal density within hen-houses are key factors on which depends chicks' mortality. Nutrition balance changes from the third week, with the view to ensuring a relatively low development of muscles which will give better laying performances. From the 17th week, begins the regulation of the light cycle, which has an important impact on laying frequency. First laying takes place in week 20. A laying hen will give from 200 up to 300 eggs during its life. After about 50 weeks, when the laying curve decreases too much, hens are gathered a few weeks out of the regulated light cycle in order to perform the so-called moulting (change of feathers). A second laying cycle can then begin. 63.
Eggs are to be collected and washed as soon as possible after they are laid, to avoid them getting dirty or broken. Attention should be paid to keep rats, snakes or other predators away from the layer house. Before slaughtering, laying hens are given appropriate feed to reconstitute muscles volume. They will be sold to consumers as low quality chickens or carved poultry meat products.

China is by far the world's largest producer and consumer of eggs. China's production has more than doubled since the early 1990's, with nearly a record 400 billion (33.3 billion dozen) produced in 1997, about half of the world's total. The U.S. is the world's second largest egg producer with 1997 production estimated at 78 billion (6.5 billion dozen). However, a major difference persists between the two nations in respect to usage. Much of China's production is directly consumed as fresh brown eggs whereas in the U.S. about a third of production is processed and white eggs are favored for table use. Egg consumption gains in developed countries and China are slowing in 1998 and 1999. Growing at a more sedate pace than the 4 percent yearly gains witnessed since the mid1980's, egg consumption is expected to slow to a two percent annual increase.

· Foreign trade in eggs is small. The net total favour exports. The EU generally accounts for about a third of world exports while Asia, paced by Japan and Hong Kong import about 75% of the total. · Asia, which constitutes nearly two-thirds of imports by selected countries (Japan and Hong Kong accounts for more than 60 percent of total imports) encountered concerns about health aspects of egg in 1998. Consequently, imports by selected countries are poised to witness a 8 percent decline in 1997, before recovering to more than 5 billion eggs in 1998. · The United States continues to be the largest shipper of egg products to world markets, supplying nearly 40 percent of imports by selected countries in 1997. · Despite declining WTO limits on export subsidies, EU exports remain surprisingly robust. An oversupply of eggs in most EU countries dropped prices in mid-1997 and 1998. Authorised restitution levels for eggs are moving progressively downward to 109 700 tons in 1998, as restitution levels edge upward to US$ 0.13/dozen. The Netherlands is the EU's leading exporter, exporting nearly 80 percent of production and accounting for nearly 60 percent of EU exports to third countries. · U.S. and EU egg exports are nevertheless experiencing increasing competition in the Middle East from regional competitors such as Turkey, Thailand and India. Turkish egg exports are destined mainly to FSU republics. They are supported through export.
subsidies of approximately US$ 0.7 per 1000 eggs, limited to 10 percent of export volume and value. The subsidy is in the form of a tax deduction rather than cash payment. · Although not showing much movement in recent years, trade in liquid egg during the nineties has been well above the levels of 10 years earlier. The bulk (80%) of this trade is conducted between European Union countries. The picture for dried egg is similar to that of the liquid product, an upward trend being evident over the past 20 years or so. Again, the majority of the business is between EU member states.
