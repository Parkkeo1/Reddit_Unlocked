1. Introduction
1.1 Objectives
The primary objective of this study is to analyse and assess woodfuel consumption in the household sector on the basis of the 1994 wood consumption survey data. Under this generalized objective the terms of reference identified the following:
(a) Present and review basic tables concerning the consumption of woodfuels in the household sector.
(b) Assess the variations in per capita and total consumption of woodfuels in the household sector.
(c) Assess various supply management issues related to woodfuel used, collection versus purchase of woodfuels and collection patterns.
(d) Assess the role of woodfuels in the household energy supply and their relative contribution in the energy budget.
(e) Present and review consumption of non-woody biomass in the household sector.
1.2 Methodology
Woodfuel consumption covers consumption of firewood, charcoal, dukhan wood and other biomass (namely agricultural residues and saw-dust). The analysis of the woodfuel situation in the household sector will be based only on the 1994 consumption survey data and covers three major aspects:
(a) Woodfuel consumption patterns where consumption expressed in terms of annual per capita and/or annual household will be carried out. This will provide the basis and guideline for future assessment of woodfuel consumption and is a useful planning figure.
(b) Current consumption aspect where the 1994 consumption estimates for individual woodfuels will be analysed.
(c) Supply management and wood resource needs where the major supply issues will be addressed in terms of woodfuel commodotization (purchase, collection etc), total resource needs and wood type used and its impact on the sustainability of the resource base.
For the above three aspects a common analytical framework will be used for the analysis. The common analytical framework has a set of parameters namely:
(i) Urbanization (rural/urban)
(ii) Income level where households are categorized into three income classes low (<Ls. 150,000), medium (<Ls. 150 000 - 300 000) and high (>Ls. 300 000).
(iii) Ecological zone where Northern Sudan is divided into four ecological zones: Desert Semi-desert, low rainfall and high rainfall zones.
(iv) Education level of the head of household. Six education levels were identified covering illiterate, Khalwa, Preliminary, intermediate, secondary and university levels.
(v) Northern Sudan and State Levels.
The 1994 national Survey data forms the basis of the analysis. The survey sampled 7500 households drawn from 53 provinces in Northern Sudan.
1.3 Report organization
The report is composed of five chapters and an executive summary. Chapter one as an introduction addressing the report objectives, methodology used and its organization. Woodfuel consumption patterns are analysed in Chapter Two. chapter three review the 1994 current woodfuel consumption as appeared from the 1993/94 consumption survey. Supply management issues and resource requirements are discussed in chapter four. Chapter five is conclusions.

2. Household woodfuel consumption patterns
Woodfuel consumption patterns analysis covers household woodfuel dependency, consumption per capita and its variation, under different socio-economic and environmental factors prevailing in Northern Sudan. Four major factors will be considered covering income education, urbanization and ecological zone.
2.1 Household woodfuel dependency
Dependency is defined by the percentage of households using firewood, charcoal or both.
At the national level the survey results clearly indicate a high dependency rate by households in Northern Sudan. Table 2.1 below presents the survey results:

(a) In aggregate household dependency in N. Sudan is generally high totalling on average (94.8%). urban households dependency (97%) is slightly higher than for rural households (93.6%). This situation reflect the greater usage of non-woody biomass by rural households. It also reflect the increased dependency of urban areas on woodfuel due to economic hardships and availability/access to other modern fuels.
(b) Even at the aggregate national level a distinct dependency pattern by woodfuel type tend to emerge. While firewood is more associated with rural households (85.1%), charcoal is mainly an urban fuel with a dependency rate of 88.9%. However despite this generalization, indications are emerging where such patterns are beginning to change. The survey results show clearly that firewood still remains a significant fuel for urban households (65.6% dependency rate). Similarly, there are trends of increased charcoal use by rural households (32.3% dependency). These changes are triggered by socioeconomic and environ mental factors (resource depletion). The significant use of firewood in urban areas, contrary to prevailing premises, can be explained by socioeconomic factors. Files and ranks of urban population continued to be intensively swollen by flows of rural migrants due to drought, economic hardships and civil strife. Such migrations led gradually to the ruralization of
urban areas.
Increased charcoal use in rural areas on the other hand seems to he associated with income rises, closeness to areas of commercial charcoal production zones (urban charcoal supply centres) characterized by charcoal abundancy and relative low prices and in areas where firewood collection/supply catchment areas are further distanced (due to degradation and desertification) to permit its economic transport.
(c) At the state level; the survey results except for a few exceptions, a high woodfuel dependency-ranging between 99.3% and 77.9% is exhibited.
(i) High rural firewood dependency compared to urban areas is generally valid for all states. The White Nile state however is the only exception where urban firewood dependency (92.1 %) by far exceeds that for rural households (58.4 %). Rural White Nile state households tend to extensively depend more on agricultural and animal waste than firewood.
(ii) Household charcoal dependency rate generally exhibit the reverse patterns for firewood. Rural populations for most the states (few exceptions) show a relatively low dependency rate when compared to urban households. Exceptions to this pattern include Sennar (82.7%), Gezira (69.8%), Khartoum (69.7%), North Kordofan (49.8%) and Gedaref (44.7%). These are either areas where firewood supply catchments are further away (e.g. Khartoum, Gezira) or near zones of commercial charcoal production zones (e.g. Gedaref, Sennar). Western states are all of particularly low charcoal rural dependency rate ranging between 1.9% (W. Darfur) to 5.1% (N. Darfur). In contrast all these states exhibited the highest firewood dependency rates (99% and 99.4% respectively). These are areas, which in general, fall within the high rainfall or rich savanna areas characterized by their extensive resource base.
2.2 Annual household and per capita woodfuel consumption pattern
Household and per capita woodfuel pattern exhibit distinct variation with urbanization. Table 2.2 presents a national overview for N. Sudan.

(a) While rural households consume on average 2.08 m^3 of firewood annually, urban ones consume only 0.78 m^3. Charcoal shows the reverse where urban households annual consumption (711 kg) is more than threefold of rural households (218 kg).
(b) Per capita consumption values are consistent with household annual values. Rural firewood per capita (0.46 m^3) is three times that of urban households (0.14 m^3). Charcoal per capita shows the reverse (0.57 m^3 for urban and 0.17 m^3 for rural).
2.3 Consumption patterns and environmental and socio-economic factors
Three major factors will be considered and their effects on household woodfuel consumption patterns will be analysed. These are the ecological zone, income and household education level.
2.3.1 Consumption patterns by ecological zone
Analysis of woodfuel consumption patterns by ecological zones reflect the impact of natural wood resource scarcity on consumption patterns. It also reflect the pressures to which the rather fragile ecosystems are subjected to. For the purpose of this analysis, Northern Sudan is classified into basically four zones. Desert, semi-desert, low-rainfall and high rainfall zones. Table 2.3 below presents the results of the analysis.

(a) Desert areas which comprise mainly the Northern strips along the Nile, households consume high quantities of firewood 2.06 M^3 year. This is even higher than the figures of the high rainfall areas where the wood resource is more abundant. This amount of high firewood consumption in desert zones should be viewed in the context of` the type of firewood used and the geographical locations where the samples were taken in villages and towns along the Nile. These areas are generally characterized by the sole use of palm trees branches and other fruit tree crops as firewood. This in itself indicates the importance of integrated agroforestry approach on one hand and the need by forest nurseries to broaden their species selection to include fruit trees on the other.
Charcoal household annual consumption in the desert zone is the lowest among all other zones. This is consistent with the absence of the wood resource base within an economic distance to allow the flow of raw materials needed for carbonization under the prevailing technologies. There seems, however, to be wide variations in charcoal consumption in the desert zone with urbanization. Urban household annual consumption for charcoal (479 kg) is more than five folds of rural households (90 kg). Firewood on the other hand shows only slight difference with urbanization.
(b) The semi-desert zone show the highest charcoal household consumption (both for rural and urban) and the lowest household firewood consumption. It is generally heavily populated where most of the densly populated urban centers are found and where irrigated large agricultural schemes are developed. The natural forest resource base is poor and hence dependency on distant supply catchment areas southwards. This offers an explanation to their high charcoal dependency and/or consumption. Firewood however still remains a significant woodfuel in rural areas of the semi-desert zone comprised mainly of bushes and small tree branches. Urban household firewood consumption is however the least in the country.
(c) Low rainfall savanna areas are characterized by medium-high annual household consumption patterns for both firewood and charcoal. In fact it exhibited the highest annual household firewood consumption in rural areas of N. Sudan (2.15 m^3 Low rainfall savanna areas are generally areas where low grade (branches/bushes) firewood is relatively abundant; and where traditional commercial charcoal production zones associated with agricultural expansion tress clearance was heavily practiced. Present trends however with accelerated tree resources depletion, show the gradual shift of semi-desert household consumption patterns.
The consumption patterns of the semi-desert and low rainfall savanna areas have the most significant impact on the woodfuel resources base due to their high population density, degree of urbanization and charcoal dependency.
(d) High rainfall areas from the present survey exhibit a high household annual consumption for firewood and charcoal. The high firewood consumption is consistent with both the dominant culture (pastoralism) of firewood use only and the availability and accessibility of the wood resource base which characterize this zone. The high charcoal consumption pattern is not consistent and must be questioned. The sampling limitation to a charcoal commercial production site need to broadened to include other high rainfall sites to correct or confirm this anamoly.
(e) Annual per capita consumption data by ecological zone show similar tendencies as shown by household annual consumption for firewood and charcoal as presented in table 3.4 below. Low rainfall has the highest woodfuel per capita (0.70 M^3), followed by the semi-dessert (0.64 m^3 high rainfall (0.63 m^3 and the desert areas with the lowest woodfuel per capita of 0.56 m^3

2.3.2 Woodfuel consumption patterns and household income
Three income levels were defined by the survey. These are low (<150000), medium (Ls. 150 000 - Ls. 30 000) and high (Ls. 7300 000) income households. Analysis of household annual woodfuel consumption by income is presented in table 2.5 below.

(a) There is a clear association between woodfuel consumption patterns and income level for both rural and urban households. It is reflected in both the magnitude of consumption and the fuel mix (firewood versus charcoal) patterns. The general trend shows that while firewood consumption decreases with income rise, charcoal consumption shows the reverse and generally increases with income.
(b) The survey data reveals a 30% drop in annual rural household firewood consumption as they move from the low to the medium income ladder. The drop in consumption decreases to 13% as income shifts from the medium to the high level. similar phenomenon is exhibited by urban household firewood consumption.
(c) The rise in charcoal consumption with income is much significant particularly in rural areas. High income rural households consumption is about eight folds of low income ones. This indicates substantial charcoal requirements with changes in rural income. For urban households where charcoal consumption is already high, income changes are associated with consumption increases by a factor of 2.5 or 1.7 for high and medium income households - using low income consumption level as basis. This may also reflect opportunities by modern fuel substitution.
(d) Analysis of consumption patterns in the various ecological zones by income level presented in table 2.6 shows the following:
(i) In desert areas where firewood is mostly the fuel used, consumption of firewood increases with income in rural and urban areas. There seems to be-a substitution effect in high income groups in the urban sub-sector. Firewood consumption dropped in urban areas as income rises from medium to high level.
(ii) For the rest of the ecological zones household firewood consumption per year tend to decrease for both urban and rural households with income rises.
(iii) Charcoal consumption patterns by ecological zones with income show tile same tendencies of increased household consumption per year as income rises.

2.3.3 Woodfuel consumption pattern and household education
Household education in this analysis is limited to only the head of the household. Six education levels were identified: illiterate, Khalwa (quranic school), preliminary, intermediate, secondary and university. Table 2.6 presents the results of the analysis.

(a) There seems to be an association between woodfuel consumption patterns and household education.
(b) Firewood household annual consumption in both rural and urban areas decreases as the level of education rises. It decreased from 2.3 M^3 for illiterate households to 1.36 M^3 for university graduates (41 %). This decrease however can not be attributed to conservation rather it is shifting to other accessible high quality fuels - mainly charcoal in this case. The only exception to this general pattern is the case of Khalwa education level households whose consumption is higher than in the previous education ladder. This can be explained by their frequent use of firewood for lighting needed to read the quoran.
Similarly firewood consumption in urban areas decreases with rise hi education level from 1 09 m for illiterate to 0.43 m^3 for graduates due to shifting to other fuels rather than conservation.
(c) Charcoal consumption shows a different pattern with education level. 1 general in both rural and urban settings there is an increase in consumption with education level rise. This trend applies all through the education levels in rural households - with consumption increasing from 153 kg. per households per year for illiterates to 545 Kg/year for graduates. The case for urban households differs slightly. Charcoal consumption increases with rise of education to a certain level (intermediate school) and then begins to drop gradually with education level rises . This indicates the shift to modern fuels (butagas etc) with certain education levels.
(d) The above apparent trends at national aggregate level are not universally applicable to each situation at state, province or district level. There are cases where firewood consumption tend to increase with education (Northern state). Such differences in trends indicate that other factors with education level (income, accessibility and price of other fuels etc) seem to govern the pattern of household woodfuel consumption.
2.4 Woodfuel per capita state level analysis
This refers to per capita consumption of firewood and charcoal. Combined in terms of roundwood requirements. Table 2.7 presents the per capita values for the different states. The following observations can be made.

(a) Per-capita consumption for rural woodfuel exhibit wide variations between states and ranges between 0.43 M^3 to 0.97 M^3 with a national aggregate of 0.7 M^3 for all N. Sudan of the 16 states five states are higher than this national aggregate, while values for the remaining eleven states are lower.
(b) In general high woodfuel (charcoal + firewood) per capita values are associated with either intensive use of firewood (N. Darfur, S. Darfur and Est Darfur) or medium to high use of both firewood and charcoal (Blue-Nile).
(c) Areas of the highest charcoal per capita (Gezira and Khartoum) exhibit the lowest firewood per capita. Areas of low charcoal per capita, on the other hand, are characterized by high firewood per capita. This reflects the wide opportunities of interfuel substitution between these two woodfuel types.
(d) States that are characterized by medium-high per capita consumption values for both charcoal and firewood (Blue-Nile) represent regions in transition towards the high charcoal low firewood consumption patterns as their relatively rich accessible wood resources deteriorate. Although such deterioration is showing at an accelerated pace.
(e) Khartoum, Gezira and Sennar states show the highest charcoal per capita. While Khartoum and Gezira are troth in the semi-desert depending on supply catchment areas more than 500 Km away, Sennar, in the low rainfall zone, is relatively close to traditional charcoal commercial production zone.
All western states, except for the semi-desert state of North Kordofan, have the lowest charcoal per capita. These are areas where the cooking and nutritional habits are tuned for the direct use of firewood. In addition they are all located in ecological zones where the wood resources are relatively rich, available and less subjected to deforestation.
The Northern desert state along the Nile also exhibit a low charcoal per capita. This is consistent with the prevailing high dependency on fruit tree branches (palm trees) as household woodfuel.
(f) Western states (except for North Kordofan) show the highest firewood per capita ranging between 0.82 M^3 to 0.73 M^3 for the three Darfur states. The situation as revealed by the survey for south Kordofan is particularly low (0.32 M^3 firewood per capita) and already an additional survey check is currently being undertaken.
(d) Classification of per capita at state level for woodfuel consumption by fuel type and urbanization is presented in table 2.8.

2.5 Woodfuel and household energy consumption patterns
Analysis of household energy consumption patterns reveals the significant role of woody and non-woody biomass in the provision of energy for the sector. Table 2.9 presents the results of this analysis.

(a) In N. Sudan per capita energy consumption in the household sector is estimated to be 0.199 TOE
(b) By fuel type biomass energy (woody and non-woody) contributes the most. Total biomass fuels contribution for household energy needs is estimated to be 93%. The remaining 7% is contributed by modern fuels. Individual fuel type contributions as shown in table 2.9 shows the significant role of firewood (55.2%), charcoal (25.1) and agricultural residues (10%).
(c) There are significant differences between rural and urban households:
(i) In absolute terms rural household energy per capita is generally higher than urban per capita (0.215 toe for rural per capita and 0.167 toe for urban).
(ii) The high contribution of charcoal in urban energy supply. Its contribution to household energy per capita is 55.6% for urban households compared to only 14% in rural households. In contrast firewood share in energy per capita for rural households (65.1%) is much higher than urban households (24.7%).
(iii) Similarly the share of agricultural residue, in rural energy per capita is equivalent to that of charcoal (14%) compared to only 3.1% in urban household energy per capita. The share of modern fuels (LPC, petroleum and electricity) is generally low ranging between 11.7% in urban and 5.4 for rural per capita.

3. Households woodfuel current consumption for 1994
This section of the report, using the 1994 consumption survey and the consumption patterns discussed in chapter 2 will review total woodfuel consumption in N. Sudan.
Total consumption analysis will be attempted in aggregate (national) and desegregate (state level) terms. The national picture will be presented using the parameters of urbanization, ecological zone, income level and education. At the state level only urbanization will be considered.
3.1 National perspective
3.1.1 Firewood consumption
(a) Rural and urban consumption of firewood
The current firewood consumption in Northern Sudan is estimated to be 5.9 million cubic meters in 1994. Of this total amount 14.5% (0.86 million M^3 is consumed by urban households, while the remaining 85.5% is consumed by rural households. This distribution pattern is consistent with the higher rural per capita and the population density - which comprise according to 1994 census about 66% of the total population in N. Sudan.

(b) Firewood Consumption by Ecological Zone
The low rainfall zone ranks the highest in firewood consumption (73.1%), followed by the semi-desert zone (23.4%), the desert zone (3.2%) and the high rainfall zones consuming the lowest firewood quantities (0.3%). This distribution pattern is due mainly to population density and per capita annual consumption in each zone.

(c) Firewood Consumption by Income Level
The overall analysis of firewood consumption by household income for 1994 shows that 42.4%, 34.8% and 22.8% of the firewood is consumed by low, medium and high income households respectively. This is consistent with per capita and distribution of population among the different income levels.

When viewed in rural and urban contexts, rural consumption by income group is consistent with the overall trend with low, medium and high income households consuming 48.9%, 34.4% and 18.5% of the 1994 consumption respectively.
The case for urban households, however, tends to be inconsistent with the per capita pattern with income (decreasing with income). Both medium and high income groups total consumption is higher than low income households. This reflects the distribution of households among the different income levels. The levels as determined in the survey analysis tend to accumulate most of the urban households in the bigger (62.8%) and medium (28.8%) income bracket. This need to be reviewed on the basis of expenditure figures to allow for a more realistic distribution of urban households by income level.
(d) Firewood Consumption by level of education of head of households
Consumption by level of education (head of household only) is presented in table 3-4 and is generally in line with per capita consumption pattern and distribution of households among the different education levels

3.1.2 Charcoal Consumption
(a) Rural and urban charcoal consumption
N. Sudan consumed in 1994 a total of 32.779 million 40 Kg sacks. This is equivalent to 1.3 million tons of charcoal. Urban households consumed 59.6% (19.5 million sacks) while rural households consumed the remaining 40.4% (13.2 million sacks). This distribution is consistent with per capita patterns and population density in urban and rural areas.

(b) Charcoal Consumption by Ecological zone
Like firewood due mainly to population density and woodfuel consumption pattern (per capita) the semi-desert and low rainfall areas together consume the bulk of the charcoal in N. Sudan - (98.6) The other two zones (desert and high rainfall areas) consume only, 1.4% of the charcoal consumed in N. Sudan. While desert areas depend mainly on firewood produced from horticultural tree branches, the high rainfall depend on firewood abundantly available in the area.

(c) Charcoal consumption by income level
In contrast to firewood high income households consume 58.6% of the charcoal consumed. Low and medium income households consume 8.6% and 32.9% respectively. This is consistent with per capita consumption patterns for charcoal which increases with income.

(d) Charcoal consumed by level of education of head of households
Charcoal consumption by level of education of head of household is governed mainly by the number of households in each education category and the per capita consumption pattern for the different education levels. However the latter is generally increasing with rise in education level. The former (population in each category) more than outweigh any per capita effects when we deal with total absolute consumption quantities. The lowest three categories in the education category who comprise the bull; of the households in N. Sudan consumed 72.7% of the charcoal in 1994.

3.1.3 Dukhan wood consumption
This special type of end-use for firewood is characteric of Sudanese married women and is widely used in both rural and urban areas. Its use is more associated with marital status of women and less so with income or education level. Compared to woodfuel use for other household purposes (cooking) it is very small (% of that firewood for cooking).
During 1994 a total of 246449 cubic meters roundwood were consumed in N. Sudan. Rural households consumed 51.4 % while urban households consumed 48.6 %. The consumption of dukhan wood is generally strongly associated with married women by tradition.

3.1.4 Other biomass consumption
Significant quantities of other biomass fuels are also consumed by households. The two major fuels consumed in addition to firewood and charcoal are agricultural residues and wood-waste (saw-dust).
Agricultural residues in 1994 constituted the bulk of the biomass fuels-other than woodfuel-consumed by households in Northern Sudan. The survey showed a total consumption of 1.37 million tons of agricultural residues of the quantities 93.4 % is consumed by rural households, while urban households consumed only 6.6%. For sawdust (wood processing residue) on the other hand only small quantities are consumed. Annual consumption for 1994 is estimated to be 17988 tons for Northern Sudan. Of this total quantity 65.5% is consumed by rural households and 35.5% by urban ones.

3.1.5 Summary of current consumption
As can be seen in table 3.11, Northern Sudan in 1994 consumed a total of 4.2 million tons of firewood, 1.3 million tons of charcoal, 1.4 million tons of agricultural residues. 0.18 million tons of dukhan wood and 0.018 million tons of saw-dust Rural households consumed 71.5% of all these woodfuel types, while the urban sub-sector consumed only 28.5 %. Analysis of woodfuel/biomass consumption in terms of energy consumption in terms of energy and round wood resource requirements will be made in chapter (4).

3.2 Woodfuels and other biomass: states perspective
Woodfuel consumption by state is a function of per capita and population. The variation between states as far as total consumption is concerned reflect these two factors. Specific data by fuel type and urbanization are shown in tables 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14.

(a) Khartoum and Gezira both with 30.4% of the population consumed 53.4% of the charcoal consumed in Northern Sudan. Such high consumption is a result of both population density and high per capita. The case for firewood for the same two states confirm the interaction of these two factors. Due to their low annual firewood per capita, these states consumed only 6.8% of the firewood in 1994.
(b) The three Darfur States with their relatively high annual per capita where 22.39% of Northern Sudan population reside, consumed 46% of the total firewood in 1994.
(c) The consumption of residue is exhibited by all states with the exception of the Red Sea state. However, 87.22% of the 1994 consumption is concentrated in Southern Darfur (45.24%), Gezira (31.75%) and White Nile (10.23%).

4. Woodfuel supply management and resource requirements
This section of the report attempts to express the 1994 current consumption levels in terms of wood resource requirements and analyse important supply management issues per training particularly to firewood (collection, collection patterns. purchase, type of wood used, etc).
4.1 Firewood
4.1.1 Type of wood used
The type of firewood consumed has far reaching implications on the management and sustainability of the forest resource base necessary to meet consumption needs. Four major wood category types were identified with a decreasing negative impact on the wood resource degradation. These categories are:
(i) Stem wood which presents the highest risk to the degradation of the resource base requiring the cutting down of the whole tree - except in high rainfall areas where there is a abundancy of dead wood (trees).
(ii) Tree branches which does not necessarily require complete tree cutting and if properly practiced and administered presents much lower risks to resource base degradation.
(iii) Small branches or twigs with little or no risk to resource base.
(vi) Bushes which also present little risk to woody resources.

(a) In aggregate the firewood consumed in the majority of the areas is of the tree branches type (56%). This generally posses less risk for resource deterioration if administered properly. Stem wood which is the most determental to the resource base, except in areas where dead trees are abandoned (high rainfall areas), comprises about 20% of the firewood consumed The remaining 24% is made of small branches (twigs) and bushes with little effect on wood resource deterioration.
(b) Rural/urban disagregation of firewood consumed by type of wood shows a similar pattern. However clear tendency is apparent for urban households to have more of their firewood as stem wood type (33%) compared to rural ones (20%). This reflects the increased pressures on the wood resource with urbanization. These pressures are more accentuated by urban charcoal consumption which mostly requires stem wood and is associated with high conversion losses.
(c) At the state level analysis of the 1994 consumption wide variations are exhibited. Detailed data by state reveal the following:
(i) Out of the 1.198 million cubic meters of stem wood consumed in 1994, Southern Darfur (30%), Est Kordofan (16%), North Darfur (15%), Khartoum (9%) and Blue Nile are the highest consumers. Such distribution pattern tend to link consumption of firewood of stem type more with areas where the wood resource is abundant and areas where, due to scarcity, firewood became a highly commercialized commodity.
(ii) The tree-branches firewood type which formed the bulk of firewood consumption (56% or 3.267 million M^3 in Northern Sudan shows a slightly different pattern. East Darfur (21%), Southern Darfur (19%), North Darfur (14%) and North Kordofan (8%) states show the highest consumption of tree branches. In contrast to stem wood type, all states exhibited consumption of this firewood type with Gezira (1 %) consuming the least and East Darfur the highest. Still the trend for increased percentage consumption characterized areas of wood resources abundancy or states where firewood is highly commercialized.
(iii) Firewood of the small branches type consumed in 1994 totalled, 0.114 million cubic metres distributed in all the states of Northern states. There is a clear tendency of higher percentage consumption for these states which generally exhibit low stem wood or tree branches consumption (Northern, River Nile, and North Kordofan). West Darfur ranked as the highest consumer of this type of firewood.
(iv) Similarly the case of firewood of the bushes type show the same trends of increased percentage consumption of states with low stem wood and tree branches (Northern, River Nile, Kassala, Khartoum, Sennar, White Nile, North Kordofan and East Darfur). Mostly these areas are in the desert and semi-desert zones. However exceptions are there (e.g. West Kordofan).

4.1.2 Purchase versus collection
(i) At the aggregate level (N. Sudan) only 28% of the firewood consumed is purchased. The remaining 72% is collected as a free good This has various economic, social and environmental implications The ratio of purchased versus collected is strongly associated with urbanization. While the percentage of the firewood collected is 14.6% for urban households, it is 82.2% for the rural case.

(ii) In economic terms such sizable free collection can be viewed positively as household savings as long as the opportunity cost of labour needed for collection does not exceed market supply cost. For the forestry authorities and state it represents a loss of revenue. Using current royalty values alone this is equivalent to an annual revenue of Ls. 469.8 million. This value in fact falls short of the resource cost of planting the trees.
At the social front this can present lost valuable time for women and children who shoulder most of the collection.
Collected quantities are generally less damaging to the natural resource environment (branch wood) than those purchased.
(iii) Firewood collection and/or purchase is also associated with income levels. In both rural and urban areas collection tends to decrease as income rises. Percentage values for collected quantities decreased with income rise from 27.4% to 8.1% for urban households; and from 92.1 % to 65.1 % for rural households.

(iv) Purchase versus collection when analysed by education level there is an apparent trend of decreased collected quantities as percent of consumption with education level. For rural households purchased quantities increased from 14.9% for illiterate to 50.80% for university graduate heads of households. On the other hand collected quantities for urban households dropped from 18% for illiterate to 2.5% for graduates. The case for urban households however showed some inconsistencies in the case for Khalwa and secondary level categories - who tend not to follow the general trend.

4.1.3 Collection patterns
The collection pattern itself in terms of family members collecting its frequency, time spent and the means of transport used has various implications and reflects a set of prevailing socio-economic and environmental conditions. The survey data showed the following results:
(i) In aggregate i.e. national overview - for both rural and urban households women seem to do most of the collection. Both men and children share a sizable portion of the burden.

However, when desegregated by state significant variations are exhibited as for as the role of household family members is concerned in firewood collection. There are instances where collection is more a man's job-than a woman's as the national aggregate tend to show. An example of such situations is shown by Kassala and Red Sea states where the percentage for women firewood collections 16.1 % and 36.1 % for the two states respectively. In contrast in all Western states firewood collection almost a woman's job. These contrasts can be explained by the different tribal culture in eastern and western Sudan. There are cases where children seem to shoulder most of the burden of firewood collection. Examples of such situations include Sennar State (60%) and Gedaref (50.3 %). Both states however relatively rich in resources and collection consumes less (of their time, hence having little) interference with their schooling and education.
(ii) The means of transport used for collection seems to indicate the nearness collecting area. The results with a 76.4% of manual (i.e. on foot) transport indicate a collecting zone within walking distance. The results also show the increasing tendency of using animal transport for collection (26.2%) which is expected to increase with present accelerated wood resource degradation. Car or mechanical transport is very limited and more used by urban households. it is interesting to note that animal transport is particularly high in states Kassala (42.7%), Red Sea (34.9%) where collection is shouldered mainly by the male members of the family. This may also be associated with the type of firewood collected i.e. stem wood versus branches.
(iii) Both collection time and frequency reflect the status of the wood resource base within collection zones. The national aggregate reveals that firewood collection is only a morning job. None of the respondents send all day in collection. There are however wide variations between and within states depending on the conditions of the wood resource base. For example 51.9% of rural household in Gezira state spend no up to noon for their firewood collection.

As far as the frequency for collections is concerned the majority of households collect firewood once every 2 to 3 days (58.1%). 18.6% of the households have daily collections frequency and 14.3% of the households with once - a week collection frequency. This aggregate picture tend to mask trends that are associated with urbanization and relative resource scarcity. Although the percentage of households daily collecting firewood in urban and rural areas are similar (only in percentage terms), the collections task in urban areas is more of a formidable task. The results also show the increased percentage of urban households that collect firewood on a weekly basis (26.2%) compared to rural households (13.2%). This percentage in relatively arid states where wood is scarce increased to as high as 36.2% (Kassala, Red Sea and River Nile States). There seems to be an association between resource scarcity and collection frequency. As resources become depleted the collection frequency
moves towards once a week pattern. Similarly for these areas time for collection increased beyond the predominant morning period and means of transport gradually shifts to animal type. There greatly increases the economic and social of firewood collection and facilitate as income rises to shift to a purchasing mode for firewood supply.
4.2 Charcoal
Unlike firewood is highly commercialized and more exacting in terms of wood type raw material used for its production. In general charcoal is always purchased and that both stem and relatively large branches are used for its production. The major supply aspects that need to be covered relate to wood requirements for its production the present conversion technologies, and its production under the economics and marketing. The conversion technologies is beyond the scope of this study. Only the amount of losses in resource terms will be estimated using the earth kiln conversion technology currently practiced. Production economics and marketing is a subject of a specific study as part of the wood products consumption survey programme. In this part of the report only round wood requirements will be assessed.
Roundwood requirements for the provision of annual charcoal consumption, using the 1994 survey data, is estimated to be 6.07 million cubic meters roundwood. This is based on present earth kiln high efficiency of 30% and a wood density value of 0.72 ton/m^3 on air-dry basis.
Of the 6.07 million cubic meters, 70% (3.64 million M^3 is lost during the carbonization process. These conversion losses are equivalent to 61.2% of the total firewood consumption for N. Sudan. The conversion factors used (may seem rather high) are based on extensive field studies in commercial charcoal production zones in eastern and central Sudan (FAO/ERI 1983, ERI/USAID, 1982).

4.3 Household woodfuel supply and roundwood requirements
The analysis of round wood needs for all woodfuel types (firewood, charcoal, dukhan) is presented in table 4.
(a) The current (1994) household woodfuel consumption requires the production of 12.22 million cubic meters of solid wood. This quantity is distributed almost equally between firewood (48.3%) and charcoal (49.7%). Dukhan wood requirements represents only 2% of the total wood requirement in Northern Sudan.

(b) By ecological zone round wood requirements is highest for low rainfall areas (56.1%) followed by semi-desert (39.6%), desert (2.8%) and high rainfall areas (0.5%) as the least. This clearly reflects the conflict of geographical distribution of population and wood natural resources in N. Sudan.

Note: Table above does not include Dukhan wood which represents only 2 % of total wood requirements for N. Sudan.
(c) At the state level household woodfuel round-wood requirements shows wide variation between states. This variation is consistent with prevailing consumption patterns and population distribution. The detailed state by state analysis is presented table 4.10. Khartoum, Gezira and S. Darfur show the highest round-wood requirements values. While Northern, river Nile, Red Sea and South Kordofan are among the lowest in terms of roundwood requirements for woodfuel. It should be noted that while Khartoum, Gezira, Northern, River Nile and Red Sea are characterized by poor wood resource base, S. Darfur and South Kordofan are rich in forestry resources. Once the data of the current national inventory becomes available it is possible to identify supply demand gaps and opportunities for inter-state trade on woodfuel products.

4.4 Woodfuel and household energy supply 1994
The household sector of Northern Sudan consumed 3.6 million T.O.E of final energy in 1994. Of this amount biomass (woody and non-woody) provided 89.3%. the remaining 10.7% is supplied by modern fuels (petroleum, LPG and electricity).
Of the biomass fuels, firewood (50.7%)_ contributed the most (1.8 million T.O.E), followed by charcoal (26.2%) with a share of 0.94 million TOE. Agricultural and wood residues (12.3%) and dukhan wood (2.%) contributed 0.45 million and 0.11 million TOE respectively.

Note: Values for conversion used in 0.43, 0.72 and 0.32 TOE per ton of firewood, charcoal and residue respectively when analysed in rural and urban context the following observations can be made.
(a) There is a difference in the fuel mix (biomass versus modern fuels) with urbanization. Rural household energy is supplied almost solely by biomass fuels which meet 97.8% of the household energy needs. For the urban sub-sector biomass provided for 80.3% of the energy needs. Modern fuels provided 2.2% and 19.7% of the sector needs for rural and urban sub-sectors respectively.
(b) The share of the different biomass fuel types themselves tend to vary with urbanization. Ranking (in terms of percentage contribution to supply final energy) for the rural subsector firewood (68.4%) and agricultural residues (16.7%) each contribute more than charcoal (15.5%). In the urban subsector however charcoal have the highest contribution (47.9%) followed by firewood (23.4%) and the combined modern fuels (19.7%).
(c) In absolute terms, more energy is consumed in the rural subsector. The latter consumed in 1994 71.3% of the final energy compared to 28.7% due by the urban subsector. This is more due to be overwhelming. 1 effect of the population.

5. Conclusions
5. Conclusions
5.1 Households have a high dependency on woodfuels (firewood and charcoal). dependency rate of 94.8 % for households in Northern Sudan is shown by the 1994 consumption survey. This dependency is also reflected in the total contributions of biomass energy in the household energy budget - which is estimated for 1994 to be 98.3% in aggregate (value for rural households is 97%).
5.2 Woodfuel (firewood + charcoal) annual per capita consumption is 0.67 M^3 for Northern Sudan. This national aggregate however varies significantly with urbanization, income class, education level and ecological zone. In general annual per capita consumption firewood is much higher in rural areas (0.46 M^3 compared to urban areas (0.14 M^3 coal shows the reverse with high urban per capita values (0.57 M^3 compared to rural J. 19 M^3 These Annual per capita values are affected by the major factors of income and ecological zone. With regards to the interaction of the consumption with these factors the following observations can be made:
(a) While firewood per capita annual consumption decreases with rise in income or education level, charcoal shows the reverse.
(b) The highest woodfuel (charcoal + firewood) annual per capita is shown by the semi-desert and low rainfall zones. An observable trend associating charcoal consumption with aridity and poor conditions of surrounding resource base can be observed. In contrast firewood tend to be associated with high rainfall and relatively rich wood resource base.
(c) Between states wide variation are shown in the annual per capita consumption values ranging between 0.43 M^3 to 0.97 M^3 Compared to the 0.67 M^3 - national aggregate average five states show higher values while eleven show lower values.
(d) In general high woodfuel consumption is associated with either intensive use and firewood (e.g. N. Darfur) or medium - high use of both woodfuel types (charcoal and firewood) e.g. Blue Nile. However it is clear that areas of the highest charcoal annual per capita show the lowest firewood per capita and the reverse is true.
5.3 The 1994 Woodfuel consumption is estimated to be 5.9 million cubic meters of firewood and 1.31 million tons (32.7 million 40 kg sacks) of charcoal. Detailed analysis of the current (1994) consumption levels slowed the following:
(a) 85.5% of the firewood was consumed by the rural households while only 14.5% was consumed b:, the urban households. This is in contrast to the charcoal where 59.6% (19.5 million sacks) were consumed in the urban subsector and 40.4% in rural areas.
(b) Firewood and charcoal distribution patterns by ecological zones showed that:
- Desert zone consumed 3.2% and 1% of the 1994 firewood and charcoal consumption respectively.
- Semi desert zone has 23.4 % and 57.2 % of the firewood and charcoal respectively.
- 73.1 % of firewood and 0.4% of charcoal in the high rainfall areas.
(c) Low income groups consumed 42.7% of the 1994 firewood consumption and 8.6% of the charcoal consumption. High income groups consumed only 22.5% of the firewood but 58.6% of the charcoal.
(d) The Northern Sudan household sector consumed a total of 246 449 M^3 of dukhan wood (A. seyal) in 1994. In addition 1.384 million tons of agricultural resides (including small quantities of saw dust) are also consumed.
(e) At state level the distribution of total quantities consumed by state depends on annual per capita consumption values and population densities. Three major features can be observed:
(a) Khartoum and Gezira consumed 53.4% of the 1994 charcoal in Northern Sudan, the rest is distributed among the remaining 14 states.
(b) The three Darfur states consumed 46.6% of the 1994 firewood consumption but only 6.5 % of the charcoal mainly due to high firewood per capita and population density.
(c) Agricultural residues consumption is associated with both rainfed and irrigated agriculture and concentrated in Southern Darfur, Gezira and White Nile states.
5.4 The total wood uptake to supply 1994 woodfuel consumption is estimated to be 12.2 million cubic meters for Northern Sudan states. 49.7% of this quantity is used for charcoal production while the rest is consumed directly as firewood (48.3%) or dukhan wood (2%).
The distribution of those resource needs among ecological zones reveal 56.1 % for the low rainfall zone, 39.6% for the semi-desert, 2.8% for the desert and 1.5% for the high rainfall areas.
5.5 While almost all the wood needed for charcoal production (6.07 million M^3 is of the stem and tree branch types posing a high risk to the sustainable management of the forest resource, firewood presents a different picture. Firewood consumed by wood type shows 20% for stem wood, 56% for tree branches and 24% for small branches and twigs.
5.6 Charcoal is a commercialized commodity. Firewood however, is still collected as a free good. In aggregate only 28% is purchased while 72% is freely collected. The percentage distribution of collection versus purchase is affected by urbanization, income, education level and ecological zone. In general purchased quantities increase with urbanization, income and education rise and increased aridity.
5.7 The collection patterns shown tend to confirm the predominant role of women in collection, extended collection periods and increased use of animal transport. Both the latter reflect the accelerated resource degradation and deterioration.
5.8 Of the total 3.6 million TOE consumed in the household sector in 1994, biomass supplied 89.3%. While charcoal consumed more in wood resource terms than firewood (6.07 compared to 5.9 million M^3 it provided only 0.94 million TOE supplied by firewood. This reflects the conversion losses associated with the charcoal production processes.
