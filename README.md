# Reddit_Unlocked: A Reddit-cal Analysis of The Web
A program for analyzing & visualizing data pulled from the Reddit API and scraped from news articles.


### What is Reddit_Unlocked?

Reddit_Unlocked is a program based primarily on Python that analyzes & visualizes data pulled from the Reddit API and scraped from news articles. Our program implements various libraries, such as Newspaper and PRAW, to gather insight about the popular types of content and trends on Reddit.


### The Why

According to Alexa, Reddit is the 5th most visited website in the United States (and 8th in the world). As a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website, Reddit represents a very significant portion of America's population of internet users. As evidenced by Reddit's higher-than-most typical per-user visit time of almost 16 minutes per day (compared to 10 minutes for Facebook and 6 for Twitter), Reddit tends to pull in users who are more likely to spend their time engaging in longer and thorough discussions to express their opinions and ideas. 

On top of all this, Reddit's voting and commenting features for every discussion "thread" enable each sub-community (subreddit) to not only aggregate news but also its users' sentiments toward and reactions to the wide range of topics in these threads. In conclusion, Reddit is essentially a goldmine for gathering and analyzing data on how the internet thinks and reacts to real-life issues and events. For our project, we wanted to tap into this goldmine to gather insights about the popular trends that permeate throughout the Reddit population and its sub-communities.
