test folder for Flask, but in order to run this project a specific environment/set of packages is required.

http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/installation/
NOTE: Instead of virtualenv, conda can be used to create virtual environments: 
https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html
https://conda.io/docs/_downloads/conda-cheatsheet.pdf

Also, there is a flaskTest folder inside of a flaskTest folder 
because that's how the Flask tutorial told me to set it up :)
