      "Injuries are becoming a worrying storyline for Watt. A back injury cost him all but three games in the 2016 season, and he dislocated a finger in the season opener, though he didn't miss a game. He also dealt with a broken hand in 2015.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he's stayed healthy, he's been the most dominant defensive player in the NFL. In his first five seasons (2011-15), he registered 372 tackles, 74.5 sacks, 15 forced fumbles, 12 fumble recoveries and 45 pass deflections.\n",

      "Pro Football Focus ranked him as its top player for the 2014 season and No. 5 player in 2015. He's a three-time Associated Press Defensive Player of the Year, four-time Pro Bowler and four-time first-team All-Pro selection.\n",
