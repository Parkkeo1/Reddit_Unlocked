<title>Strategic grain reserves - Guidelines for their establishment, management and operation. (FAO Agricultural Services Bulletin - 126)</title>
<section>1</section>
Preface
These guidelines have been prepared to assist those countries which have moved, or are in the process of moving, towards a liberalised system for marketing agricultural produce and who wish to maintain a strategic grain reserve to guard against possible failures of the free market to cope adequately for the food needs of the population.
Past experience of maintaining strategic grain reserves has mostly been associated with strictly regulated cereal markets in which the government, or a government controlled agency, was the only official participant. With liberalisation interventions by government, unless they are carefully designed, are likely to distort the normal functioning of the market which, in turn, will have implications for the activities of private sector participants. To minimise such disruptions there is a need to adopt a different approach for the management and operation of such reserves which takes into account the mechanisms operating in the free market.
Various options are available for the design and operation of a reserve depending on the medium- to long-term objectives of government and the general conditions influencing the functioning of the market. To assist in this process, various options which should be considered in deciding which are the most appropriate to meet the government's policy objectives are presented in these guidelines.

Section one - Introduction
The need to maintain stocks of grain in years of good harvests to guard against famine in those years when production falls short of needs has been recognised throughout history. Perhaps the earliest recorded instance was the biblical reference to the build-up of stocks by the ancient Egyptians during seven years of plenty to cover for the prophesied seven lean years.
In modem times the establishment and maintenance of Strategic Grain Reserves, or Food Security Reserves, stems from the events of the early 1970s when a prolonged drought in the Sahel, resulted in a series of disastrous harvests throughout the region. The seriousness of the situation was compounded by a simultaneous world-wide cereal shortage which led to prices rising to record levels. With limited availability and high prices the donor community was only able to provide limited amounts of food aid with the result that many people in the region experienced famine. The effects of these events were also felt in many other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa which, because of scarcity and cost, had difficulty in making adequate provision for needed imports to supplement their own shortfalls in production. To reduce the severity of such events in the future, governments in several vulnerable countries, in consultation with the donor community, embarked on the development of
programmes aimed at ensuring an adequate availability of food for affected populations and the development of national food security strategies^1 Emphasis was put on propositioning stocks of basic cereals in vulnerable Sahelian countries to be held in readiness for use in the event of future food emergencies. These stocks were not intended to cope with the entire emergency, but rather to provide for the basic needs of the affected population during the lead time required for arranging the availability of alternative supplies. Priority was generally given to ensuring an adequate availability for the urban population, i.e. market dependent population, as it was assumed that the rural population would have retained sufficient stocks, or otherwise made adequate provision for meeting its basic food needs, e.g. through the production of alternative drought resistant crops such as cassava. Subsequently, it was realised that there were vulnerable groups amongst the rural population
which should also be included when considering releases from the reserve.
^1 The establishment by FAO of the Food Security Assistance Scheme (FSAS) was one of the outcomes of these international deliberations.
Determination of the need for a reserve, its size and the arrangements for its management and operation were set by government, frequently with the help of aid agencies such as FAO and bilateral donors. The physical establishment of the reserve was often an integral part of donor supported programmes aimed at strengthening national food security. Typically an initial quantity of grain would be donated by a donor, e.g. WFP, in the expectation that it would act as a catalyst for contributions from other donors. Grain from the reserve which was sold into the market was expected to be replenished through purchases in the domestic market following harvest by the agency responsible for managing the reserve. Funding for these purchases was expected to come from the monies generated from sales from the reserve. It was also expected that donor assistance would be forthcoming to help replenish those quantities which had been distributed, either free or at subsidised prices, to
vulnerable population groups under relief programmes during food emergencies.
Throughout the period from independence until the late 1980s the grain market in most countries of the Sahelian and Sub-Saharan region was strictly regulated by government, with normally a strong bias towards the politically more active urban population. Low consumer prices were maintained by a combination of low producer prices and heavy subsidies. Pan-territorial and pan-temporal pricing systems were the norm for both producer and consumer prices, and private sector participation in the market was actively discouraged. Parastatal companies, or marketing boards, with monopoly rights for the marketing of designated cereals, and in some instances the provision of inputs, were established to administer the system. These companies were also normally given responsibility for managing and operating the reserve stocks^1 However, problems faced by governments in providing adequate funds to the parastatals to finance their operations often led to reserve stocks being used for normal
market operations. Financial pressures on both governments and the parastatals resulted in insufficient resources being made available to replenish the reserve stocks at the start of the following marketing year. At the same time the donor community, which was facing increasing demands for food aid, was becoming steadily more disenchanted with the way that reserves stocks were being used and was increasingly unwilling to provide the resources necessary for rebuilding stocks. Progressively, the quantities held in reserves dwindled, eventually ceasing to exist in most countries. The Malawian grain reserve was a notable exception to this generalisation as were the reserves held as buffer stocks within the normal operational stocks of the parastatal grain agency, e.g. Kenya and Zimbabwe. Thus, for many countries the strategic grain reserve, while continuing to form an integral part of the government's food security programme, tended to exist in theory rather than in practice.
Following the collapse of the socialist system at the end of the 1980s there has been a general move throughout Africa towards economic restructuring and market liberalisation which has led many countries to introduce policies aimed at deregulating markets and encouraging private sector participation. Cereal markets, traditionally one of the most politically sensitive areas, are increasingly becoming involved in this transition process. Subsidies have, or are being, eliminated and governments are progressively withdrawing from intervention in the market. To encourage private sector participation parastatal grain companies have lost, or are in the process of losing, their privileged monopoly positions and for the first time have to face competition in the market. Prices controls have also been relaxed or eliminated leaving market forces to set prices while other restrictions, which had served as a barrier to entry into the market, have been abolished. However, because of its
sensitivity, there is often concern in government circles that a liberalised cereals market, driven by profit motivated private sector traders, would cater adequately for the needs of the population. To act as an insurance against the failure of the private sector to make adequate provision, particularly in times of production shortfalls, there has been a reawakening of interest in government of the role strategic grain reserves could play in ensuring an adequate availability of basic cereals in a liberalised market.
^1 Food Security Reserve stocks were established in several Sahelian and Sub-Saharan countries over the period 1975-1980 e.g. Burkina Faso, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Ethiopia, and Tanzania
The mechanisms required for maintaining and operating a reserve under free market conditions are very different from those which were suitable for a regulated market in which the government, or a government controlled agency, was the only official participant. Due regard now has to be given to ensuring that the basic requirements of a free market are not being violated and that the operations associated with reserve do not disturb the orderly functioning of the market. Clearly, there are several possible options open to governments wanting to make the change from a regulated to a free market and for the manner in which a reserve functions. Countries which already have a functioning reserve (e.g. Malawi and Tanzania) or are maintaining a buffer stock which also serves as a reserve (e.g. Kenya and Zimbabwe) still need to consider the various options available for progressively adjusting the manner in which their reserves operate to meet the changing circumstances as the
transition process proceeds. Similarly, those countries which are considering establishing, or re-establishing, a reserve stock need to assess the various options to identify those which best suit their situation.
While they may have similar objectives and common features, the management and operation of strategic grain reserves will differ between countries to take into account their specific circumstances and government policy. Other factors which could also have an influence include: the likely cause and nature of food emergencies and the available mechanisms for coping; the market structure and the effectiveness of market participants to cater for market needs with food emergencies. By presenting various options these guidelines are intended to provide a practical guide for those involved with determining the need, and an appropriate structure, for a strategic grain reserve.

Definitions
A generally accepted definition of food security is "a situation in which all people at all times have access to adequate quantities of safe and nutritious food to lead a healthy and active life". This definition requires three basic conditions to be met: 1) adequacy, i.e. supplies from domestic production, stocks and imports are sufficient to meet the nation's needs, 2) availability i.e. stability of supply both spatially and temporally throughout the year and 3) access, i.e. the population has sufficient purchasing power to gain access to its food needs. Strategic grain reserves help address the stability problem.
In most countries there groups of people who are, or are vulnerable to, food insecurity. These are usually separated into two groups, those who are chronically food insecure and those who are transitory food insecure. The chronically food insecure include those sectors of the population which lack adequate income, assets and/or resources at the household level to produce or otherwise gain access to the basic food needs of the household. Chronic food insecurity results from structural problems and as such cannot be overcome by periodic interventions of food from the reserve. Its resolution requires programmes aimed at identifying and conquering the underlying reasons for the population's inability to produce sufficient foodcrops, or other economically tradable outputs, e.g. non-food crops, to meet their needs. In the meantime they require continuing targeted support programmes aimed at providing the means for them to gain access to their basic food needs. Meeting the
supplementary food needs of such population groups would not normally be considered to be a function of a strategic grain reserve, but rather for specialised relief programmes; such as food for work, food stamps or other targeted interventions. The transitory food insecure are those households which, under normal circumstances, are able to produce or gain access to their basic food needs but are vulnerable to supply problems when external shocks affect their food production systems or distribution chains for a limited period of time. For rural populations this is generally related to instances which have a seasonal impact on crop production, e.g. drought and floods, while for urban populations it is related to the availability of, and the ability to access through purchase, food in the marketing chain. By their nature events resulting in transitory food insecurity are usually of limited duration, e.g. a single crop season, and, once conditions return to normal, the affected
population is usually able to rapidly recover its food security. Due to the unpredictability and non-continuing nature of such events, a strategic grain reserve provides a useful tool for helping to cope with the problems of transitory food insecurity when it arises.
By providing a breathing space between the identification of the possibility of either a national or a localised food shortage occurring and making the necessary arrangements for mitigating its impact, a food security reserve provides a first line of defence for coping with food emergencies. For the purposes of a food security reserve a food emergency can be defined as: "when there are clear indications that an acute and widespread food shortage, extensive suffering and dislocation in the life of the community on an exceptional scale are imminent, and that these dangers cannot be overcome by the normal supply procedures". Such an emergency would normally be caused by drought, floods, storms, earthquakes, crop failures resulting from pests or disease as well as from man-made causes, such as war and civil strife.

Section two - Policy and strategy considerations
From regulated to free markets
The role of strategic grain reserves
From regulated to free markets
The collapse of Soviet Union has led to a general recognition that the adoption of central planning as the role model for economic development had failed to live-up to its expectations. As a result, and with encouragement from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the donor community, many governments which had followed the interventionist path have now embarked, or are in the process of embarking, on a programme of structural adjustment. A cornerstone of this transition process is market liberalisation.
Within the agriculture sector the ultimate objective of market liberalisation is the abolition of existing regulations controlling and/or restricting the production and marketing of agricultural commodities in favour of a free, and competitive, market in which the private sector is the major participant and government intervention, if not eliminated, is minimised. Achievement of this objective will require that many long and closely held political convictions, conceived in the interests of developing social equality, will have to be revised. Chief amongst these are the concepts of government price regulation, in particular pan-territorial and pan-temporal prices, and the use of subsidies to keep prices of basic commodities below their true economic levels. If the proper market signals are to be sent to producers and consumers alike and the private sector encouraged to participate in the marketing process, prices have to be free to move in accordance with the prevailing
market conditions. The private sector will, however, only be interested in investing in the grain market if an acceptable margin can be made by either moving grain from surplus to deficit areas, i.e. there are spatial price differences, and/or by storing grain early in the season for sale later in the marketing year when prices rise, i.e. there are temporal price differences. An essential first step in the liberalisation process is therefore to allow prices to vary from location to location and throughout the marketing year to reflect local and ultimately national availability and demand. Initially the extent to which prices are allowed to vary may be limited to avoid too great a shock on the existing system and to allow time for the private sector, and consumers, to adjust to the new circumstances. Subsidies, which have a distorting influence on the production and market decision making processes, also need to be abolished at an early stage to ensure that the correct market
signals are sent to producers and market participants alike.
While full market liberalisation may remain the ultimate objective, due to the political sensitivity of the cereal sub-sector, it is probable that many governments will want to retain some supervisory influence, or involvement, to ensure that the market is adequately providing for the needs of producers and consumers and that attempts to manipulate the market by the unscrupulous are prevented. The extent to which there should continue to be a residual government role will depend on the efficiency and transparency with which the free market is operating and the danger, perceived or real, of circumstances arising in which the private sector is unable, or unwilling, to cater adequately for the needs of consumers. It is thus in the government's long-term interests to allay, to the extent possible, any lingering concerns which the private sector may have with respect to the market to encourage their fall and active participation the market. Any residual government involvement in
the market should therefore be undertaken in support of, and in cooperation with, the private sector rather than in competition with it. This requires that the government gains the confidence of the private sector. Progress towards this goal can be made if the government is prepared to be open about the role it intends to play during the coming marketing year and under which circumstances, and in which manner, it will intervene in the market. Failure by government to recognise the importance of cooperating with the private sector will result in a loss of confidence by traders in the government's intentions which, in turn, will result in them curtailing, or discontinuing, their activities when trader perceptions of the risk of incurring losses through government intervention are high. To promote this spirit of cooperation consideration needs to be given to using private sector channels when government intervention is considered necessary, e.g. by purchasing grain for the
reserve and selling grain from the reserve through private sector traders.
There are two routes open to governments considering moving from an existing regulated to a free market, the "big bang" and the gradual transition. Under the "big bang" major changes are introduced immediately with final restructuring of the market completed within one or two years. The major changes would include: the abolition of subsidies and fixed prices in favour of market determined prices; opening the market to private sector traders and companies; privatising or abolishing parastatal grain agencies or, where they continue to function for the time being in the public sector, requiring them to operate commercially and without access to privileges which are unavailable to private sector traders, e.g. access to cheap credit; removal of restrictions concerning the free movement of grain in the country and opening the import/export markets.
The gradual approach, as it implies, involves a more cautious liberalisation process in which the government progressively relaxes control of, and involvement in, the market while simultaneously encouraging the private sector to take over market activities. The period of time taken to complete the transformation process would depend on circumstances but could typically be spread over 4-5 marketing years. The rate of progress would depend on the rate at which confidence can be built-up in government circles that the private sector is sufficiently developed and responsible to undertake market operations in an orderly manner. Similarly, it would also depend on the response of the private sector to the market opportunities offered and the extent to which their interest can be encouraged. Clearly moving along the liberalisation process one or two steps at a time provides all participants; i.e. government, producers, traders, processors and consumers; with the opportunity for
gradually acclimatising and adjusting to changing market conditions. However, as the private sector is motivated by profit, market regulations need to be relaxed sufficiently from the outset to provide scope for traders to make an adequate margin on their transactions if they are to be encouraged to invest in grain trading. The gradual approach also helps to avoid the likelihood of major shocks occurring in the marketing system which could have serious humanitarian and/or political implications. This is particularly the case for those countries which have operated a strictly regulated market over a prolonged period where it would be unrealistic to expect private sector traders, who have undergone years of suppression, to be able to step into the gap left by a sudden government withdrawal from the market. Traders will need time to build-up their capacities, in particular marketing chains and working capital, as well as their confidence and experience under the new marketing
conditions. While petty traders, many of whom were previously operating informally in the parallel markets, will quickly become established trading small quantities and taking advantage of short-term arbitrage opportunities, traders with the resources to take longer-term positions, or to trade in sizable quantities, will take longer to become established. Market infrastructure will also need to be developed to meet the new conditions, e.g. privately owned or operated storage facilities and marketplaces, in particular assembly and wholesale markets, where grains can be freely traded. Similarly, processors, retailers and consumers will have to learn how to operate in a free market, and government needs to be assured that the market can operate effectively and not against the interests of producers and consumers, i.e. through manipulation of prices and supplies, or against national interests.

The role of strategic grain reserves
Coping with food emergencies
Price stabilisation
Loan operations
In addition to their prime function of helping to cope with food emergencies strategic grain reserves can also be used to serve other functions. Most commonly they are given a price stabilisation role and occasionally the role of providing loans of grain to recognised organisations/agencies, e.g. when they experience delays in the arrival of their regular supplies. In determining whether it would be appropriate for a reserve to be used for undertaking such functions an assessment needs to be made of the possible additional risk if the reserve is unable fulfill its prime function as a result of such additional activities. This in turn will depend on the ability of the government, through its early warning or similar systems, to determine the likelihood of a food emergency arising during the current, or approaching marketing year, and the likely quantities of grain which would be required from the reserve to meet any such emergency. Quantities of grain held in the reserve
which are surplus to these requirements could be assigned for other purposes.
As a general rule, the greater the number of responsibilities which a strategic grain reserve is required to undertake the larger will be the size of the reserve, or the resources required by the reserve. Government has therefore to make a value judgement of the additional benefits which could be obtained from broadening the role of the reserve against the likely additional cost.
With a long history of suppression of the private sector and government intervention in the market, it is to be expected that private sector traders will, for some time, be suspicious of government's intentions with respect to the use and operation of a strategic grain reserve and thus be wary of being too exposed in the event of an unexpected government intervention in the market. To allay these concerns government needs to adopt a transparent approach to the management and operation of the reserve by keeping traders fully informed of its intentions and avoiding actions involving use of the reserve in ways which could undermine confidence amongst traders.
Coping with food emergencies
Over the last twenty years many of the countries of Sahelian and Sub-Saharan Africa have experienced food emergencies of varying severity on several occasions, the most common cause of which has been drought. While the area has always been susceptible to erratic rainfall, the frequency with which the rains have failed in recent years appears to have increased with two or three poor rainfall years occurring together. Thus, while people may be able to cope with a single year of drought they face increasing difficulty in sustaining themselves over a period of sequential droughts as occurred in the Sahel in the early 1970s and in Ethiopia in the early 1980s. Although drought is the dominant cause of food emergencies, the countries are also susceptible to other events which can lead to food shortages either on a localised, national or regional scale. These include: floods, pest attack, i.e. locusts, and man-made events such as war and violent civil disorder which destroy the
production base and/or the distribution structure, as have occurred in Burundi, Mozambique, Rwanda and Somalia.
The prime function of a strategic grain reserve is to provide a first line of defence in the event of a food emergency. Excluding the chronically food insecure, the sectors of the population that are vulnerable to periodic food emergencies fall into two broad categories. The first are those who are normally dependent on the market for their supplies, i.e. the urban population. This group is particularly important in Zambia where some 60 per cent of the population are urban based. Urban dwellers would normally have the resources to purchase their food needs from the market, but they can be vulnerable to shortfalls in market supplies and/or exceptionally high prices which, in a free market, are a reflection of supply shortfalls. When shortages start to appear in the market, or when prices reach unaffordable levels, this group can normally be catered for by ensuring that additional supplies are released into the market, e.g. through imports or sales from a grain reserve,
thereby exerting a downward pressure on prices. The second group comprises those people in the rural areas who are normally self-sufficient but, in times of food shortages resulting from poor harvests or damage to their on-farm stocks, do not have the resources necessary for purchasing their additional food needs from the market. This is the typical situation of the vulnerable population groups in Malawi which has a rural subsistence economy. For these groups releasing grain into the market does not resolve their plight as, due to a lack of purchasing power, they are unable to gain access to it. Under these circumstances special relief programmes such as food-for-work, food stamps and supplementary feeding programmes, are required to provide for these people. The availability of a strategic grain reserve would enable such humanitarian programmes to be rapidly initiated, however, unlike market releases of grain from the reserve, releases of grain for relief operations do not
generate income with which the reserve can be replenished by subsequent market purchases. To replenish the grain government will either have to make additional financing available, which given the precarious state of national finances in most countries is usually problematic, or, more commonly, through an appeal to the donor community.
Price stabilisation
The concept of price stabilisation can only be applied under circumstances in which market prices, producer and/or consumer, are allowed adjust to reflect market availabilities, otherwise there would be no price fluctuations to stabilise, i.e. they would remain constant at the price set by government. It also implies that there is a government agency, i.e. a parastatal, to intervene in the market as well as other operators, e.g. cooperatives, private traders, and mills, who have a degree of flexibility to set prices and whose actions bring about price fluctuations in the market. Under a system of price stabilisation government would typically attempt to maintain prices within a range, i.e. a price band. This price band would be bounded at the lower end by a floor or producer price and at the higher end by a consumer or ceiling price. Once prices move outside these limits the responsible grain agency would be required to enter the market and either buy at the floor price when
farmgate prices fell below it or sell grain into the market if consumer prices exceeded the ceiling. The objective being to keep prices within the preset price band.
It has to be recognised that private sector involvement in any business activity is driven by the profit motive. Unless there is a clear indication that the potential profit from an investment is adequate to cover the perceived risk the private sector will not be interested in participating in the market. Therefore when determining the limits of the price band sufficient difference has to be made between the floor and ceiling price to enable an adequate profit to be made after all costs have been taken into account; i.e. handling, storage, transportation and financing; if the private sector is to be stimulated to invest in grain marketing.
Price stabilisation comprises two concepts, producer price support and consumer price stabilisation. Under producer price support a floor price is set at which the agency charged with operating the price stabilisation policy, normally the parastatal grain agency, is required to buy all grain offered which meets a quality specification, i.e. the agency becomes the buyer of last resort. Although it may sometimes be set at an incentive level, in an attempt to encourage additional production, the floor price would normally be set at about the cost of production to minimise any production and marketing distortions which a higher price would tend to encourage^1 For countries which regularly have production surpluses, due notice needs to be taken of the export parity price when setting the floor price, as this is likely to approximate to a free market purchase price in years of surplus.
^1 By offering so called "incentive" prices to producers for white maize on a pan-territorial basis countries such as Tanzania and Zambia encouraged its production in areas which were better suited to more drought resistant crops. As a result, in years of poor rains, farmers in these areas experienced disastrous reductions in production, often leading into transitory food insecurity. The severity of such calamities would probably have been significantly lower had millet and sorghum production been encouraged in these areas rather than maize.
A producer price support system is more feasible to operate if the obligation to maintain pan-territorial prices is abandoned in favour of declaring a few key points at which the floor price would be maintained. These would normally be at key storage locations of the parastatal agency. Producer prices away from these buying points would be allowed to vary according to market forces from the floor price. For example, in years of surplus producers distant from these buying points would receive a price lower than the floor price to reflect the costs incurred by the traders moving grain from the farmgate to the buying point. In years of surplus the buying agency would expect to buy substantial quantities of grain, particularly after harvest when the market price is at its lowest, while in years of deficit production the producer price would normally be higher than the floor price with the result that the quantities of grain offered to the buying agency would be minimal. However,
depending on the size of the shortfall in production and the proportion of the crop marketed at harvest, there may be a period when producer prices, even in poor production years, fall below the floor level. To provide some support to remote or disadvantaged areas, where prices would normally be expected to be low, consideration could be given to making preferential purchases in these areas. Because of their remoteness and the cost of moving the grain to a consumption area, it is likely that the cost would be higher for purchases in these areas^1 but government may consider that the social benefits out-weigh the higher financial cost. Care should, however, be taken to ensure that such support purchases due not unduly distort the normal functioning of the market.
^1 If it was commercially profitable to buy grain in these areas private sector buyers would already be active in the market.
Abolition of pan-territorial pricing and limiting the number of points at which the floor price will be supported can lead to political pressure to increase the number of buying points as politicians attempt to curry favour with their electorate. As the establishment of prices which reflect the true market value of commodities at specific locations is the cornerstone of a free market, such political manoeuvring needs to be resisted if a free market structure is to be realised.
The quantities of grain purchased under a producer price support programme could either be used as part of the parastatal grain agency's normal operating stock, become part of the nation's strategic grain reserve or form part of the stocks used by government under its relief programmes for combating chronic food insecurity. It should be borne in mind, however, that in the years when the grain agency purchases substantial quantities of grain, i.e. when market prices are low, there is likely to be a surplus of grain in the market and thus, the likelihood that the reserve will be called upon to meet food shortages will be low. Conversely, in years when the agency buys little or no grain, because the producer price is above the floor price, i.e. years of relatively poor production, the likelihood that the reserve will be required to meet shortages is relatively high.
Consumer price stabilisation aims at capping consumer price levels at a declared ceiling price. This would usually occur in the later part of the marketing year when there is pressure on prices to rise as stocks start to run low. Once consumer prices reach the ceiling, or trigger price, grain would be released from the reserve into the market in an attempt to hold prices at the ceiling level. Care needs to be taken of the manner in which releases are made from the reserve to ensure that disturbances to the normal functioning of the market are minimised, and that private sector participants are not discouraged from participating in the market. This is particularly important when the private sector is being actively encouraged to import grain to make good shortfalls in market availabilities. Private sector importers will only be prepared to make arrangements for imports on their own account if they are assured that the government will not release grain into the market from the
reserve, or any other source, at prices below the prevailing import parity price at the point of sale, i.e. the price at which grain can be purchased on the international market and delivered to a specific location within the country. Thus, if traders are to import grain, they need to be assured that the government will not release grain from the reserve into the market a prices below the import parity price.
Circumstances can arise when the import parity price is too high for the market to bear, i.e. consumers would be unable to afford to pay the real market price even though grain was available on the market, the government has the option of, either importing directly itself and then releasing the grain into the market at a price below the import price, or providing an import subsidy to traders to compensate them for the losses they would have incurred. Forced into a situation where one of these two options has to be used, the government would probably be better advised to adopt the former, i.e. to arrange for the imports directly, for the following reasons:
- when government is responsible for making import arrangements under circumstances of high international prices and/or high transport costs from a port to the required location, e.g. land-locked countries such as Malawi and Zambia, there is always the possibility of government being able to negotiate for a proportion of the required imports to be supplied on concessionary terms by a donor. This would reduce the average cost per tonne of the imports to government and therefore the potential loss if the grain has to be released into the market at a subsidised price;
- as there are likely to be shortages throughout the country, the government, which would control the imported stocks, has a social responsibility to ensure that there is a fair distribution of the available stocks throughout the country. This would normally not be of concern to private sector traders, who would be wanting to maximise their profits;
- import subsidies are open to abuse by unscrupulous traders.
To avoid disturbing the normal functioning of the market and risking the alienation of private sector participants as well as to minimise the operational cost to government of intervening in the market, the private sector should be actively involved in the process of consumer price stabilisation. This can be achieved by government releasing grain from the reserve into the market through sales to traders. The traders would then distribute the grain to the market using their established marketing channels. The advantage to the government would be that there would be no need to establish costly distribution systems alongside those of the traders. Such sales could be made at a fixed price set by the government or by public auction.
Zambia Safes from Food Security
Reserve by Public Auction
To avoid the impact that releases from the reserve could have on the normal functioning of the market the government of Zambia adopted in 1995 a system of open public leaders for the sale of grain from the reserve. Under this system stated quantities of gram in specified locations were offered for sale through press advertisements. An independent organisation was appointed to administer the tendering process and subsequent sale of the grain on behalf of the government. During the first half of W5 a total of 1,5 million bags were auctioned in three equal tranches.
To ensure that as wide spectrum as possible of private sector operators could participate in the tendering process, a two tier system was adopted. This enabled various bidders to submit bids for varying tot sizes, e.g. milling companies could bid for up to 10 lots of 5,000 bags, while hammermills and traders could bid for up to i& lots of 500 hags. The bidding process was on a "where is and as is" basis. Bidders in addition to stating the number of lots, price per lot and location from which they wished to buy were also required to make a deposit equivalent to 1,0 per cent of the value of the bid on, submission of the bid. The opening of the bids was undertaken publicly with alt bidders being invited to attend. For the first auction a total of 179 bids were received, of which i4& were from hammermills and traders. Approximately 58 per cent of the- bids were successful.
By reducing the risk of major price escalation or fluctuations, price stabilisation can provide government with a useful mechanism for the smooth transition from a regulated to a liberalised market. It could also provide the parastatal agency with the time it requires to restructure so that it is able to operate commercially in a competitive environment.
Loan operations
Although the necessary action may have been taken to arrange for the supply of grain to meet particular needs, e.g. imports by private sector traders to meet a market shortfall and food aid shipments for relief programmes targeted at the chronically food insecure, events outside the control of the responsible agencies can result in a delay in the receipt of the shipment, e.g. shipping delays, grain quality below contract specification. Such circumstances can result in shortages occurring in the market or in relief programmes having to be suspended pending the arrival of the shipment. Provided that there are no imminent demands likely on the grain reserve for meeting food emergencies, consideration could be given to authorising "loans" from the reserve to the agency concerned. Such loans would be "repaid" from the shipment, when it arrives. Care needs to be taken to ensure that grain quality requirements for replenishment, as well as quantity are adequately specified. To
guard against possible default, particularly when the borrower is a commercial or public sector organisation, proof needs to be given as to how the loan is to be repaid and the transaction is covered by a legally binding agreement. Consideration could also be given to requiring an irrevocable bank guarantee for the value of the loan which would be redeemable in the event of a default.
Using the strategic grain reserve in this manner was a common feature in operations of the Ethiopian food security reserve during the 1980s, when loans were made to NGOs who were experiencing delays in the arrival of food aid or who had under-estimated the needs of their relief programmes and were awaiting the arrival of additional shipments. These loans were then repaid by the NGO immediately after the arrival of the shipment. During the 1994 refugee crisis when large numbers of people were suddenly forced to flee from Rwanda, the Tanzanian strategic grain reserve was used to supply grain "on loan" to donors, in particular WFP, to enable relief operations to be initiated. Had the reserve not been in position considerable delays would probably have been encountered in mobilising alternative supplies, with a resultant increase in human suffering.

Management information systems
Crop production forecasts
Market information systems
Early warning systems
Once a decision has been taken that a strategic grain reserve should be established the requirements and the various options open to government to meet those requirements need to be considered. Decisions will need to be taken concerning the mechanisms required for monitoring market conditions, and the ownership, structure, size, location and financing of the reserve.
Under a regulated marketing system, the government, through various departments in the Ministry of Agriculture, e.g. extension and statistics, and through the parastatal agencies responsible for cereal marketing, has, or should be in a position to amass, the information necessary for monitoring fairly reliably the overall food situation in the country. Based on its assessment of the likely market developments, the government is solely responsible for taking the necessary decisions concerning the need to import, or export, and the likely need for releases from the reserve during the course of the marketing year to cope with envisaged food shortages. However, once the first steps towards market liberalisation have been taken, control over the market begins to slip from the government's gasp into the hands of the other participants, i.e. private traders. Under such circumstances government needs to review its information requirements and sources to enable it to have a reliable
overview of market conditions and prospects.
When the grain market was a government controlled monopoly the marketable surplus was normally purchased soon after harvest. The quantities of grain available to meet market requirements would be known and thus, in years of poor production, the expected shortfall which would need to be covered, either by imports or by a reduction of stocks. Under a free market the quantities of grain marketed, held in store, either on-farm or in traders'/millers' warehouses, is unknown, and not possible to obtain with any degree of reliability^1 Foreign trade arrangements made by the private sector would also not be known unless special arrangements have been made, e.g. through a system of import/export licensing. Government is therefore increasingly forced to rely on secondary data to monitor the current and expected market conditions. This would involve the use of market prices, price trends and movements as a proxy for assessing market availabilities. Thus, as liberalisation proceeds, the
government will become increasingly dependent on the collection and analysis of statistical data if it is to keep abreast of market conditions and be able to assess likely future market developments. This will require that greater attention is given to improving the quality and reliability of production forecasts and on the development of market information and early warning systems than has been common in the past. The less reliable the available information is, the greater will be the degree of uncertainty in the assessments of the likely market developments, and thus the greater will be the provision which will have to be made to ensure that the market will be adequately catered for.
^1 As in a free market producers tend to hold stocks on-farm in the hope of receiving a higher price later in the season the quantities marketed at harvest are likely to be lower than under a regulated marketing system. These quantities are impossible to determine with any degree of reliability. Also, for commercial reasons, private sector companies are unlikely to respond reliably to requests from government concerning the stocks of grain they are holding.
Governments have been traditionally unwilling to make the necessary investments in developing and maintaining effective information systems in the firm belief that they can not afford the resources. However, it needs to be remembered that such information systems can, by providing reliable information, help the government avoid the high costs of coping with an unexpected, or poorly prepared for, food emergency. Clearly the reliability of the information systems available to government relating to production and market forecasts will have a direct bearing on the size of the strategic grain reserve needed to give the required degree of protection.
Crop production forecasts
Estimates of the production of key crops are usually made during the growing season based on area planted and expected yield. These estimates are finalised following harvest when the results of crop cutting surveys are normally also included in the calculations. However, the reliability of these estimates varies considerably between countries. With market liberalisation the timeliness and reliability of production forecasts for basic food production becomes increasingly important to government as an early indicator of the likely food situation facing the country in the coming marketing year. Armed with this information the government is in a stronger position to assess the probability of food shortages arising and the likelihood of demands being put on the strategic grain reserve.
In most countries the past neglect and/or under-resourcing have resulted in relatively unreliable crop forecasting systems. Governments will therefore need pay attention to the need to strengthen their crop forecasting systems to improve both timeliness and reliability of information. In some countries different agencies may be involved in preparing independent crop forecasts^1, this often leads to substantial variances which can be difficult to resolve. The situation can be made more complex by interdepartmental rivalries resulting in a reluctance to accept information prepared by others. As an alternative, consideration needs to be given to appointing a single authority with responsibility for preparing consolidated crop forecasts. The authority would be mandated to bring together those agencies/departments which are currently engaged in making crop estimates, or could usefully contribute to the estimating process with the provision of appropriate information, and to
jointly develop a coordinated and consistent approach to crop forecasting. The authority would be responsible for assessing the information provided by each agency/department and for the preparation of a consolidated forecast. Ideally mechanisms should also be established for comparing forecasts with the subsequent observed results with the objective of identifying the reasons for any significant variances so that procedural adjustments can be made to improve the reliability of future forecasts. Currently such post factum reviews are rarely if ever undertaken.
^1 In Kenya four agencies prepare separate production estimates, viz. Ministry of Agriculture, Central Bureau of Statistics, Department of Resource Surveys and Remote Sensing and the parastatal grain agency. National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB).
Market information systems
Market transparency is of fundamental importance for the efficient operation of a free market. It requires the ready availability to market participants; i.e. producers, traders and retailers; of information relating to prices and availabilities in key markets throughout the country. The availability of this information stimulates market users to exploit spatial price differences by moving produce from low-priced to high priced markets, i.e. encourages arbitrage, and, apart from inter-market handling costs, the equalisation of prices between markets. As market prices under a regulated market system were intended to be fixed there was no need to develop systems for monitoring market prices and availabilities, as a result most countries embarking on the liberalisation process do not have systems in place for providing market users with price information. The establishment of a market information system (MIS) for use by both government and traders which provides regular
information through the media on the prevailing market prices and availabilities needs to be given a high priority by government in its market liberalisation policy.
Zambia Market Information System
The Agricultural Market Information. Centre in the Food Security Division of I the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, with the help of the FAO Marketing Management Assistance Project produces a Weekly Market Bulletin: containing information on: the prevailing wholesale and retail market prices for a range of basic commodities and inputs m 9 key markets, the prevailing prices on the Agricultural Commodity Exchange, tables and graphs showing price treads for maize over the past year and an assessment of market conditions. Other information which may be of interest to those involved with the market, e.g. the government's policy for maize marketing in the coming year, is also provided from time to time
The information is made available, each Tuesday for the prices at the end of the previous week to the media, press and radio for publication It is also available on subscription and can also be accessed directly by E-Mail (faoamic@zamnet,zm or faomsff@zamnet.zm)
In addition to providing market information such a system could be extended to include market intelligence, in particular the government's assessment of the food situation in the country, e.g. production, market demand, as well as estimates of import need or export potential, international prices and other information of general interest to the trade. Appendix 1 provides an example of a weekly market bulletin produced by the Zambian Ministry of Agriculture. The wide dissemination of such information by government to traders would help them make more informed judgements of market requirements, thereby improving the efficiency with which the market operates. Such improvements in market efficiency would offer a direct benefit to government by reducing the provision it has to make to cover for any weaknesses in the marketing system.
Crucial to the usefulness, and hence its likelihood of success, of a market information system is the speed with which information can be made available to potential users. Common criticisms of market information systems are the problems of organising the regular collection of price and availability information from selected markets and the cost of collection, particularly if special teams of collectors are employed by the responsible department. These costs can be minimised if responsibility for the collection of the information in a standardised format is transferred to the market authority, often the municipality. The cost of collection can then be recouped through the system of market fees. In this way the users of the market, who are also be the main beneficiaries of the information disseminated, would be responsible for covering the costs of collecting, and possibly also processing and disseminating, the information. The service could therefore become self-financing
The information collected in the selected markets would be transmitted directly, by fax or modem, to a central agency, usually based in the Ministry of Agriculture, which would process the data and then retransmit it to the markets, media and subscribers. The central agency would be responsible for determining: the data to be collected, designing a standardised format for the ease of collection and processing, and for training and monitoring the data collectors to ensure that they follow established procedures.
Early warning systems
Many Sahelian and Sub-Saharan African countries which are susceptible to food emergencies have established early warning systems responsible for gathering together all the information which has a bearing on the current and expected food situation in the country and preparing regular reports assessing the prevailing food situation in the country and the prospects. For Southern and East African countries regular regional early warning reports are also prepared by regional units based in Harare (SADC) and Djibouti (IGAD)^1.
^1 SADC countries associated with the Regional Early Warning System are: Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The IGAD countries are: Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, and Uganda.
Information used for providing early warning assessments of the future food situation bring together information from a variety of sources including: remote sensing; agro-meteorological information, particularly rainfall data; and crop forecasts. Timing interpretation of this information can play an important role in alerting governments and traders to the likelihood of food shortages occurring later in the food year, or in the following food year. With such advance warning there should be sufficient time for the government, or responsible public agencies, e.g. the agency responsible for the strategic grain reserve, to take appropriate action to cope with a pending emergency.
Again the reliability, and timeliness, of such information has a direct bearing on the size of the reserve required. The better and more reliable the information is with respect to giving advance warning of those events which are possible to foresee, e.g. drought, the lower will be the requirement for the reserve.
<section>8</section>
Ownership
The functions of a strategic grain reserve are essentially humanitarian in character. As is common with most humanitarian activities, many of the operations which will be undertaken by the reserve are inherently non-commercial and are therefore liable to incur financial losses. The humanitarian, and social, functions that the reserve is expected to perform are decided by government and should be clearly spelt-out at the time of its establishment along with the circumstances, and the manner, in which, the reserve is expected to be used in the event of adverse conditions arising. A strategic grain reserve is therefore one of the tools available to government to support its humanitarian responsibilities and its social policies. As such the government must be prepared to provide the necessary financial support, through periodic financial injections, if the reserve is to be able to sustain its activities.
Taking these factors into account, it is to be expected that ownership of the reserve will ultimately rest with government. Government, however, may choose to operate the reserve through a government department, e.g. the Food Security Department in Tanzania, or appoint a semi-autonomous agency, e.g. the Food Reserve Agency in Zambia, to administer the reserve on its behalf. Alternatively, it could appoint the parastatal grain agency, e.g. NCPB in Kenya, or a commercial organisation, e.g. as ADMARC is in the process of becoming in Malawi, to administer the reserve on a management fee basis. Whichever option is selected the government would ultimately be responsible for the cost of maintaining the reserve.
<section>9</section>
Management of the reserve
Management structure and staffing
Although the main function of a strategic grain reserve is social/humanitarian in nature it also has to be recognised that there are often political connotations related to its management and operation which need to be taken into account. While basic principles can be laid down for the management and operation of a reserve, because the social, and possibly political, implications of food shortfalls can be extremely sensitive, government would normally want to retain some powers of discretion over the use of the reserve. This would be particularly the case when such decisions involve the government in additional costs. The extent to which the government would want to, or should, exercise such control would vary from country to country. For example in Tanzania the government, through the Prime Minister's Office sanctions all releases from the reserve, while in Zambia the Food Reserve Agency is empowered to make market releases without recourse to government while decisions
relating to releases intended for humanitarian relief are the responsibility of the Office of the Vice President. In designing the overall structure for the management and operation of the reserve a decision has to be taken relating to the responsibilities to be retained by government and those to be delegated to the agency charged with the management and operation of the reserve.
The main responsibilities which should remain under government control are:
- monitoring the performance of the entity charged with the management and operation of the reserve, and taking the necessary action to correct adverse trends;
- ensuring that the entity is acting in accordance with its approved mandate;
- monitoring the efficiency with which resources entrusted to the reserve are being utilised;
- reviewing the audited accounts of the reserve's activities;
- modifying or otherwise adjusting the mandate, i.e. authority and responsibilities, of the entity to meet changing circumstances;
- authorising actions to be undertaken which involve the government incurring additional costs, i.e. increasing the resources available to the reserve, sanctioning releases of grain for relief actions.
As a guiding principle in determining the responsibilities which remain with government care should be taken to avoid government using its authority to interfere directly in the management of the reserve, particularly with respect to directing or promoting social actions which could be interpreted as having political objectives, or other actions which could have a damaging impact on the functioning of a liberalised market. Decisions which are of a purely operational nature should be left to the entity responsible for the reserve. To avoid future misunderstandings between government, the concerned entity and traders relating to the functioning of the reserve it is advisable to specify clearly the responsibilities of the government and the entity in an Operational Procedures Manual. This would, inter alia, also provide a distinction between their respective roles and thereby help ensure that the opportunity for government to interfere is minimised.
Within the government, institutional options for vesting responsibility for the reserve include: a high level committee, composed of senior officials from relevant ministries, e.g. Ministries of Agriculture, Food, Finance, Home Affairs and Health; the office of a senior minister or a designated department in government, e.g. Food Security Department.
In the past this responsibility for the management and operation of the reserve was usually entrusted either to the parastatal grain agency or to a specifically created institutional entity. The National Cereals and Produce Board, in Kenya, and Grain Marketing Board in Zimbabwe are examples of parastatals which were given responsibility for managing and operating the strategic grain reserve. In these instances the reserve was treated as a buffer, or minimum, stock within the normal operational stocks of the parastatal. As such there was no physical separation of the reserve or special requirements to be met for its use. Conversely, the establishment of a specialised entity, e.g. the Food Security Units in Ethiopia and Tanzania, was associated with the physical separation, and identification, of the reserve from normal operating stocks. Set conditions were established which had to be met before grain could be released from the reserve, e.g. the declaration of a food emergency
and high level authorisation for the release of grain. As these specialised entities did not have direct access to storage facilities, or experience of grain management, the physical storage of grain was normally contracted out. The parastatal was usually appointed to this task as it was often the only organisation with both storage facilities and experience of grain storage management.
With the introduction of market liberalisation there will continue to be a need for an institutional entity with responsibility for managing the strategic grain reserve. As before the choice lies between giving the responsibility to the parastatal or a retaining management within government by giving responsibility to a government department or through the creation of specialised semi-autonomous entity.
The process of market liberalisation will bring about fundamental changes to the structure and role of the parastatal grain agencies. While some may remain in the public sector others could eventually be privatised or, as happened to Namboard in Zambia, wound-up. From the outset of the liberalisation process parastatals will lose their monopoly of the grain market and, for the first time, have to compete alongside the private sector for the purchase and sale of grain. To avoid charges of unfair competition by the private sector the parastatal will need to operate according to commercial principles and no longer be able to depend on the government covering commercial trading losses. Although the parastatal may be required to undertake certain social responsibilities, e.g. price stabilisation, particularly during the early transitional stages, care needs to be taken to ensure that these do not create opportunities for conflicts of interest. Such a situation could arise between
a parastatal's commercial grain marketing activities and the non-commercial, government financed, activities associated with managing the reserve. For example, a parastatal could always be open to charges of making stock, or financial, manipulations between the reserve and its commercial activities to its advantage. If the parastatal is to be given the responsibility for the reserve, as is the case of ADMARC in Malawi, an essential requirement should be the separation of activities associated with the management and operation of the strategic grain reserve from those associated with normal commercial market operations. Of key importance is the separation of financial accounting of the costs incurred by, and revenues accruing to, the reserve from those of commercial activities. To protect its interests the government may also wish to appoint a higher level authority to act as a "watch dog" to monitor the parastatal's actions. With a parastatal managing and operating the
reserve there may also be private sector complaints that they are debarred from bidding for some of the potentially profitable aspects of managing the reserve, e.g. grain storage.
Zambia Food Reserve Agency
The Food Reserve Agency (FRA) was established in 1996 as a semi-autonomous corporate body with responsibility for managing the National Food Security Reserve. To this end the FRA purchases grain at the beginnig of the marketing season for release at market value under the circumstances that the private sector is unable to meet the market demand for grain. The total quantities to be. Purchased each year will be determined by the FRA on the basis of the country's food outlook and the financial resources it commands. All purchases and; releases will be made at the prevailing market paces with the full participation I of the private sector through open public tender. Physical storage of the grain^ held in the reserve will be contracted out to private sector companies by open tender. The FRA is headed by a Board comprising 10 members, seven of whom are drawn from various sections of the private sector.
Specifically the FRA is not a buyer of last resort, it does not buy commodities at guaranteed prices, there are no floor or ceiling prices and it has no mandate to operate a system of price stabilisation.
The alternative to appointing the parastatal for the management of the reserve is the establishment of a specialist entity or agency. As it would be responsible for administering public funds, the entity itself should probably be within the public sector^1 It could be a department within a ministry e.g. the Food Security Department in Tanzania, or a semi-autonomous body such as the Food Reserve Agency in Zambia. While overall responsibility for the reserve would be vested in the entity, many of its activities could be undertaken by the private sector, e.g. by contracting out or tendering for the purchase and sale of grain, and for the storage of grain.
^1 It is also conceivable that a private sector agency could be appointed a manager of the reserve in return for a fee.
Whichever structure is chosen for managing the reserve there will be a need to appoint a governing body with overall decision making responsibility for matters relating to the management and operation of the reserve. This could be a Board of Directors as is the case for the Food Security Agency in Zambia or a Board of Trustees for the Food Security Department of the Ministry of Agriculture in Tanzania. For parastatal, and private sector organisations the governing body would need to be a governmental structure, e.g. an interministerial Food Security Committee in Ethiopia. The composition of the governing body, particularly those responsible for specialised reserve agencies, can have an important influence on the manner and effectiveness with which the reserve functions. For example although the Boards governing the strategic grain reserves in Tanzania and Zambia have similar responsibilities their structures are very different. In Tanzania the strategic grain reserve, which
has a separate legal status, is administered by the Food Security Department, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. A Board of Trustees, chaired by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, and comprising representatives from various ministries is the main decision making body concerning the reserve. In contrast the Food Reserve Agency which was recently established in Zambia is a semi-autonomous corporate body governed by a Board of Directors of whom seven out of the Board of ten are drawn from the private sector (see Appendix 5) Thus, while the Tanzanian reserve is firmly under government control, in Zambia the functioning of the Food Reserve Agency is strongly influenced by the private sector

Option Responsibility for Reserve
Advantages
Disadvantages
Comments
Parastatal
a) Structure already in existence., therefore no need to create another agency.
a) Possible problem of maintaining a separation between operational and reserve stocks, finances and costs.
a) Government must ensure that parastatal operates without any privileges, e.g. losses written off, access to subsidised bank loans.
b) Parastatal familiar with the grain market and with grain storage.
b) Government may be reluctant to reimburse parastatal for the costs incurred in maintaining the reserve.
b) Management fee for managing and operating the reserve should be negotiated annually.
c) Continuing temptation for government to require parastatal to intervene in the market or undertake social activities.
c) Government will need to independently supervise parastatal on a regular basis to ensure that the reserve is fully accounted for and in good condition.
d) Private sector always suspicious of parastatal's position.
Institutional Entity
a) Entity is only responsible for the reserve, and therefore can be easily held accountable,
a) Need to establish a new, albeit small, entity.
a) Entity should have control over the financial resources made available for the reserve As reserve has no other source of income, the government must be prepared to pay for all social interventions it requires the reserve to make, preferably at the time of the intervention.
b) No conflict of interest with commercial activities.
c) Entity can be seen to be neutral by private sector in the operations it undertakes e.g. purchasing, recycling and releases.
d) Entity able to contract out most of the operational activities associated with managing the reserve, and thereby reduce operational costs.
Government Department
a) Entity is only responsible for the reserve, and therefore can be easily held accountable.
a) Continuing temptation for government to require parastatal to intervene in the market or undertake social activities.
a) Financial costs of maintaining and operating the reserve have to be paid for directly.
b) No conflict of interest with commercial activities.
b) Department likely to be viewed with suspicion by private sector
c) Department able to contract out most of the operational activities associated with managing the reserve, and thereby reduce operational costs.
c) Government departments are notorious for their lack of understanding of the workings of a free market
The advantages of bringing the private sector into the management of the reserve include:
- the opportunities for government to adversely interfere in the management and operation of the reserve are significantly reduced;
- greater transparency in the management and operation of the reserve;
- greater attention paid to the cost effectiveness of the reserve's operations;
- reduced likelihood of market operations undertaken by the reserve adversely distorting the grain market;
- strengthening private sector confidence in the government's policy of non-interference in the grain market;
- encouraging a increased willingness of private sector traders to recognise the reserve more as a partner than a threat.
The decisions for which the governing bodies are responsible for making and the procedures which should be followed need to be specified in an Operational Procedures Manual. Similarly, the decisions which management of the agency responsible for the reserve are authorised to take and the procedures they are required to follow should also be clearly specified in the manual.
Routine operational activities such as warehouse management would normally be under the direct control of the agency responsible for the reserve. However, for activities which are related to the integrity of the reserve or could have an impact on the market, it may be considered necessary to require a more senior authority to sanction the activity. There may also be a difference between those activities which can be undertaken directly by the parastatal and specialised reserve agency.

Management structure and staffing
The organisational structure required for the management of the reserve will vary depending upon the particular circumstances and nature of the organisation responsible for the reserve. For those reserves which are to be managed by the parastatal, there will probably be no need to establish a separate department, division or management structure. There will, however, be a need to maintain separate records and accounts as well as to maintain separate physical stocks. As these additional managerial and staff responsibilities and tasks could, in most instances, be given to the existing staff of the parastatal there should be no need for the parastatal to increase its staffing to manage the reserve. A senior manager would need to be designated for making operational decisions related to the reserve, within the scope of authority delegated to the parastatal, and for liaising with the higher level body responsible for authorising activities which are outside the parastatal's
jurisdiction.
A specialised reserve agency will, however, need to establish a management structure to meet its specific needs. Although these structures can be expected to differ between countries, an example of a typical basic organisation structure is given below. Usually the organisation would be headed by a General Manager who would be responsible for the overall management of the reserve and accountable for the activities undertaken. In the organisation chart three basic functions have been identified: stock management, finance and administration and market monitoring. Other functions may be required depending on the responsibilities given to the agency. For example, the Food Reserve Agency in Zambia in addition to being responsible for the maintenance and operation of the strategic grain reserve is also responsible for leasing, or renting, the publicly owned grain storage facilities. It has therefore established a Properties Department to specifically look after the management of
these facilities.
The stock management function is responsible for ensuring the integrity of the physical stock which is held at any particular time in terms of quantity and quality. Depending on circumstances the stock may be held in storage facilities which are operated by the reserve agency, as is the case in Tanzania, or stored under a contract arrangement with public or private sector companies, as in Malawi. Staffing requirements, and costs, are likely to be higher if the stock is held in storage facilities operated by the reserve agency. While manual staff may be hired on a casual basis as required, there will be a need for some permanent staff at each storage location irrespective of the stock held, e.g. storage manager, storekeepers and security guards. As stock movements into and out of the reserve are infrequent, staff productivity is inherently low in comparison with storage facilities catering for normal market needs. Labour costs per tonne handled can therefore be expected to be
correspondingly high. Contracting out grain storage should reduce these costs as the charges incurred to the contracting organisation will be based on the stock actually held rather than on the capacity of the facility used. There will, however, be a need for additional inspectors to monitor stocks and supervise movements into and out of the reserve, e.g. ensure that the quality of grain purchased is in accordance with specifications, that the grain is fully accounted for and that its quality is satisfactory.
A Finance and Administration function will be required to manage the financial resources of the reserve. This would include investing cash generated from the sale of grain until such time as it is required for stock replenishment. In addition the function should be responsible for the preparation of an annual financial report for submission to government for audit and an annual budget specifying its financial requirements, in accordance with standard government practice. It should be headed by a qualified accountant who would be supported by clerks/bookkeepers as required.
Typical Organisation Structure for the Management and Operation of a Strategic Grain Reserve
The Market Monitoring function would provide a regular flow of information to the General Manager on the prevailing market conditions, in particular market prices and price trends. It would be responsible for making recommendations on the need for, and timing of, sales to combat market shortfalls and for recycling stocks as well as for purchases to replenish the reserve. Additionally, it would monitor prices and availabilities in the international market to advise on the prospects for grain imports. Recommendations prepared would be submitted to the governing body of the agency for sanctioning action. The information required would be sourced from other government agencies e.g. Ministry of Agriculture for production estimates and the early warning system. The market information and market intelligence derived from these sources should, in addition to being made available to reserve management and relevant government departments, also be made available as a service to the
private sector. It should be headed by an economist with experience of market analysis.

Size of reserve
Traditionally the target size of a food reserve was determined on the basis of the cereal requirements of the vulnerable population for the time required following the recognition of an imminent food emergency until additional supplies could be made available for distribution, i.e. the lead time. For the purposes of calculation it was typically assumed that the cereal requirement was equivalent to some 160-175 kg per person per year and that a lead time of three months would be required to organise and receive additional supplies. The resultant size for the reserve was held static at this level until circumstances were considered to have changed and the calculation was repeated. This was usually only after several years. Countries which adopted this approach included: Ethiopia (with an initial reserve size of 180,000 tonnes), Mozambique (60,000 tonnes), and Tanzania (100,000 tonnes).
As an alternative some countries based the size of their reserve on market demand, for example Zambia determined the target size for its reserve at an estimated three months' market demand, equivalent to 2.0-2.5 million 90 kg bags, i.e. 180-225,000 tonnes. While Kenya (3.0 million 90 kg bags), Malawi (180,000 tonnes) and Zimbabwe (936,000 tonnes) decided on their reserve stock needs using more pragmatic assessments.
The above methods used for determining the size of reserve stocks assumed that the consumption pattern of the affected population would remain constant and that the, so called, food gap, i.e. the difference between availability (production and opening stocks) and consumption requirements, would be filled by a combination of stock reduction and imports. However, in times of food shortage people change their eating habits, by switching to alternative foods, e.g. cassava and other root crops instead of maize, or, in the extreme, by eating less^1 thereby reducing the demand for the staple food. There is thus, a tendency to over-estimate the size of the food shortfall and consequently the size of the reserve required to cope with it. To avoid this pitfall due account needs to be taken of the likely extent to which vulnerable households will switch to alternative foods when determining an appropriate size for the reserve.
^1 This is discussed in "Food Security in Malawi: A Market Oriented Approach", USAID, 1996.
Given the variable nature of the frequency and scale of events which can precipitate a food emergency and the prevailing monopolistic structure of the grain market, the methods of determining the size of the reserve discussed above would probably have been more than adequate to cope with the initial needs of all but the most devastating emergencies. However, the target levels were seldom put to the test during the 1970s and 1980s as vulnerable countries were unable to establish or maintain reserves at the target levels. An exception was Malawi which established and maintained its target reserve level and was able to combat two food emergencies successfully, in 1987 and 1991. However, by maintaining large reserve stocks on a continuing basis, including years of good harvests when it was unlikely that a food emergency necessitating the use of the full reserve could arise, the government has had to bear a needlessly high cost. This is particularly the case for those countries
which have high rates of interest which, under the terms of their structural adjustment programmes, can no longer be subsidised. There is therefore a need to consider alternative methods of maintaining a reserve which provides an acceptable level of ability to cope with food shortages while being less financially demanding.
The introduction of a liberalised market also has implications for the circumstances under which a strategic grain reserve is required to operate. The government, having given up its monopoly position in cereals marketing, is no longer aware of the quantity of grain marketed and does not have control over all the marketed grain stocks. These were key factors used by government in the past for determining and administering the food needs of the country. Instead government now has to depend on secondary information, such as prevailing market prices, market availabilities and price trends, to determine the market prospects and the likelihood of an emergency arising. The situation is further complicated for those countries which oscillate between surpluses and deficits, particularly when traders are also involved in importing and exporting grains. Under such circumstances the government is not necessarily aware whether adequate provision has been made by the private sector to
cater for the import needs of the country. To be able to monitor the situation the need for an effective information system, as discussed earlier, assumes paramount importance.
Malawi Strategic Grain Reserve
The strategic grain reserve, set at 180,000 tonnes by government was established in the early 1980s to its target level. Apart from normal stock rotation the reserve was not required oaf a the poor harvest year of 1987 which coincided with an influx of refugees from Mozambique, The reserve was drawn down and subsequently replenished by donors. The reserve was again required in 1991 as a result of drought. Thus, over the period 1981-1996 the reserve has been required on two occasions but the level of stock has been maintained at, or close to the reserve target level for most of the rime. Tire cost to the government of maintaining the reserve could have been substantially reduced had an assessment been made of the likely need for the reserve each year and the stock adjusted accordingly.
The cost of establishing and maintaining a grain reserve is directly related to its physical size. Reducing the average size held would therefore result in a lower cost to government. This could be achieved, without jeopardising its ability to cope adequately with the initial stages of a food emergency, through the adoption of a policy of adjusting the size of the reserve according to the prevailing circumstances rather than attempting to maintain a reserve of a fixed size irrespective of the circumstances.
Within the Sahel and Sub-Saharan Africa the most likely cause of a major food emergency historically has been drought. Floods, although prevalent in certain areas, are normally limited geographically and, for all but the most serious, have a lesser, and localised, market impact than droughts. However, while floods can strike with little or no warning, the implications of a drought on domestic grain production, and therefore on the grain availability in the following marketing year, should have been recognised well before harvest. As there is rarely a total crop failure the impact of the drought on the availability of grain in the market is only likely to start to be seriously felt after 3-4 months into the next marketing year. Initially this would be evidenced by higher real market prices for grains, with a possible increase in demand for alternative foods, coupled with prices starting to rise earlier than normal in the marketing year. There should thus be a warning period
of at least 6 months that there is likely to be a food shortage. This should provide an adequate lead time for government to make a reliable assessment of the size of the shortfall and initiate measures necessary for coping with the situation. The assessment could also be used for determining the likely demands that could be put on a strategic grain reserve, and thus the size of reserve which would be required. By adopting this approach the physical size of the reserve could be adjusted each year in accordance with the perceived needs. Thus, in years of good production or surplus, when the demands on a grain reserve are likely to be low, the size of the reserve would be reduced. Conversely, in years of poor production, e.g. as a result of drought, the size of the reserve would be increased to enable it to cope with the increased likelihood of a food shortage arising.
Ethiopia Strategic Grain Reserve
In 1981 an FAO mission recommended the establishment of a strategic grain reserve of 180,000 tonnes to help cope with food emergencies- The size of the reserve was based on an assessment of up to 3,7 million vulnerable people who would seed to be provided with a basic food ration for an expected lead time to mobilise additional supplies of four months, In 1987, the ODNRI, using the experience of the disastrous drought of 1983 and the resultant famine, advised that the size of the strategic grain reserve should be increased to 205,000 tonnes, sufficient to provide: a 95% protection for a period of up to 6 months to a potentially vulnerable population of 4,3 million people^1. This calculation assumed that the mobilisation time for additional supplies would be some 5-6 months.
^1 The Size, Location Infrastructure and Management of a Food Security Reserve to Assist Famine Relief in Ethiopia, ODNRI, 1987.
Such a system of a variable, or dynamic, reserve size requires that an annual review is undertaken by the responsible government agency, e.g. Early Warning Unit, to determine the food prospects for the coming marketing season. Normally this would be done some 2 -3 months prior to harvest, i.e. when reasonable forecasts of crop production should be available. This review would then form the basis for the governing body of the agency responsible for the reserve to make a decision on the size of reserve required for the coming season. Because of the number and variability of the factors involved, many of which are non-calculable, e.g. the quantities of grain which will be imported by private sector traders or the extent of a switch to alternative foods, determination of the size has to be made on the basis of reasonable assumptions and past experience. It should, however, be remembered that the size can always be adjusted as new, or improved, information becomes available. Even
within a season the reserve size should not be immutable, but rather be in a continual state of adjustment to meet circumstances as they arise. In determining the size for the reserve certain principles should be observed: For example:
- there should be a minimum size for the reserve to act as an insurance against unforeseen circumstances. Initially this could be set at about one month's market requirements;
- while there should be no maximum size for the reserve it should not normally be greater than the quantity required to meet the market demand for the lead time needed to arrange alternative supplies.
As the quantities required for the reserve would vary from year-to-year so would the financial resources required to purchase and maintain the reserve. This would mean that either the government would have to make provision for a variable level of funding each year or the responsible agency be allowed to hold and operate funds provided on a continuing basis. In the first instance the reserve would need to make a budget request each year for the funds required to bring the reserve stock up to the determined level. This may cause problems for the allocation and release of funds due to the fiscal year not coinciding conveniently with the crop year, i.e. when government budget allocations are made the requirements for the reserve may not be known, or to financial constraints on government. With the reserve agency administering the funds the necessary purchases could be made as and when required, up to the limit of the available funds, without recourse to government. Using this
system the reserve would be held in varying combinations of physical stock and cash, with the cash component representing the residual financial resources available for the purchase and maintenance of stocks after the needed stocks have been purchased. Thus, in years when there is surplus production, and the likely demand on the reserve is low, the physical stock would be correspondingly low and the cash account^1 high. The reverse situation would apply in years when poor harvests could lead to food shortages. Depending on the ability of the reserve agency to regenerate its funds from releases into the market, it may be necessary to periodically request government for additional funds to finance grain buying operations. This would be more likely to occur in years of poor production when larger reserve stocks are required and domestic grain prices are likely to be higher. This type of approach to maintaining and operating the reserve has been adopted by the Food Reserve
Agency of Zambia.
^1 These funds should be kept in a deposit bearing account, preferably in foreign convertible currencies. This would enable the agency to protect the value of its funds against the risk of local currency devaluation, and to also have funds available to purchase on the international market if necessary.
With full market liberalisation the private sector would be expected to actively participate in the import, and export, of grain on its own account to meet its perception of market opportunities. However, as it is not the responsibility of the private sector to take social considerations into account in its normal operations, it will only invest in the import, or export, trade if it considers that the investment and risk involved will be adequately compensated by the potential opportunities for making an acceptable profit. Basic conditions that must exist for traders to consider investing in importing grain include:
- a belief that the market price will rise above the import parity price for a reasonable period. This is a fundamental requirement if grain importing is to be a profitable business venture;
- confidence that the government will not take actions which could distort the market to such an extent that importing grain becomes unprofitable or too risky. This would include: releases of grain into the market, from the reserve or from other stocks it might be holding, e.g. food aid, at below import parity price;
- adequate access to the credit required to be able to buy grain in the international market in economic quantities for the mode of transport used.
As the private sector is profit motivated any grain it imports will be destined for sale in the market. It would be unrealistic to expect private sector traders to also import grain to meet the needs of vulnerable groups who do not have the resources to purchase grain in the market at the prevailing price. This is a social responsibility for which government has to make separate arrangements, e.g. food for work, food stamps. Traders are also likely to err on the conservative side when arranging imports, i.e. they will tend to under-import rather than over-import to avoid being left with high cost stocks at the end of the marketing year when prices can be expected to fall as the new crop comes into the market. It could therefore be that responsibility for ensuring that the market is adequately supplied in the final weeks of the marketing year will rest with government through releases of grain from the reserve to make good the shortfall of private sector imports. Additionally
the government will continue to be responsible for making provision, through releases from the reserve, for the needs of those transitory food insecure who are unable to access the market.

Composition of the reserve
Physical stocks
Combination of physical stock with a cash component
The composition of the reserve is usually considered to refer to the physical composition of the reserve; e.g. the proportion, or quantity, of the different types of grain held. This was probably satisfactory when strategic grain reserves were a fixed size. However, taking a broader view of a strategic grain reserve, the composition should be extended to include other resources available to the reserve, i.e. cash which can be used for domestic and/or international purchases. Thus, it should be legitimate to consider a reserve as comprising a certain proportion in physical stocks, which themselves may contain different types of grain, and the remainder being in the form of cash, or, alternatively, a combination of cash and other instruments^1 which is readily available to the agency responsible for the management and operation of the reserve.
^1 For example options and futures.
Physical stocks
In an ideal world a strategic grain reserve would comprise a range of cereals reflecting the preferred staple of the potentially vulnerable population. However, such a benevolent approach can cause problems, albeit inadvertently, which not only increase the cost of establishing and maintaining the reserve, but could also increase the vulnerability of some rural population groups to food insecurity. For example this could occur if they were to become accustomed, through releases from a reserve, to a grain type which is agronomically unsuited to the area, e.g. white maize in drought prone areas or whose normal market price is beyond the normal purchasing power of the population group, e.g. rice.
As a basic principle a strategic grain reserve should comprise cereals which are widely consumed, normally readily available in the domestic market and preferably locally produced. In selecting the grain type, or types, for the reserve there will always be a trade off between which grains are preferred by the potential beneficiaries and their cost relative to an acceptable alternative. For example while, for social reasons, consideration may be given to holding some quantities of rice in the reserve, with a cost per tonne at least double that of white maize, sorghum and millet, and a nutritional value which is not markedly higher, it is difficult to justify a rice component for the reserve. The cost of establishing and maintaining the reserve is also likely to be higher when it contains several grain types, as the need to maintain different stock combinations in different areas will increase demands on transport, handling and administration. Thus, from a purely cost and
operational stand-point, it would be advantageous to have only one type of grain in the reserve, e.g. white maize, as has been the case for most African countries to date, rice in Far East countries and wheat in the Near East.

Comments
Single type of grain
a) Procurement, storage recycling and releasing operations simple.
a) Can encourage a change in eating habits. This can lead to greater production instability if grain type not suited to particular area, e.g. if the reserve comprises white maize, it could encourage the production of maize in drier areas where sorghum, millet or cassava are more appropriate crops.
a) Grain type must be acceptable to the potentially vulnerable population.
b) Managerial and operational costs reduced as need to redistribute stocks, minimised.
b) Grain must be normally readily available in the market.
c) Grain should be as low priced as is consistent with (a) above.
Several types of grain
a) Provides opportunity for the agronomically most suitable grain to be provided, thereby reducing the risk of changing eating habits and encouraging the production of an unsuited grain.
a) Complexity of management and operational activities increases substantially with increases in the number of grain types, e.g. to ensure that the right amount of the right grain type is in the right location at the right time
a) Government has to assess the cost benefit of maintaining more than one type of grain, and be prepared to make the additional resources available.
b) As prices vary between grades average cost of grain purchases likely to increase, thereby increasing the cost of the reserve to government.
c) Management and operational costs are increased as the quantities of grain to be relocated is increased
Combination of Physical stock and Cash
a) Physical size of the reserve can be adjusted to meet the expected reserve needs
a)
b) Cash resources of the reserve should remain under the control of the responsible agency or there could be a danger that the cash is not available when required.
b) Overall cost of maintaining reserve reduced as average stock level reduced.
c) Opportunity to invest cash in interest bearing account.
c) The total real value of the physical stock and the cash components would remain constant. With an increase in one being balanced by a decrease in the other.
Cash
a) Cost of maintaining the reserve reduced.
a) Possibility that grain will not be available when required, due to slow response or ordering delays.
a) Cash resources of the reserve should remain under the control of the responsible agency or there could be a danger that the cash is not available when required
b) Possibility that white maize, the preferred grain will not be available in the event of a regional drought.
There may, however, be sound reasons for considering holding more than one type of' grain in the reserve. This could be particularly the case in areas that depend predominantly on subsistence farming, where it would be undesirable to create a demand for a grain which is unsuited agronomically to the area through periodic releases from the reserve. In these instances it would be preferable to make available a grain type which can be produced in the area, e.g. millet and sorghum in drought prone areas. Under such circumstances there may therefore be an advantage in having limited amounts of a second or third grain type in the reserve. In deciding on which grains to hold, it should be remembered that, from a practical perspective, the purpose of the reserve is: to provide an acceptable wholesome basic food until such time as additional supplies can be mobilised at the minimum affordable cost to government and which does not adversely distort normal consumption patterns.
Following this course it should not be the responsibility of government to make available a preferred but more expensive food when there is a cheaper, and acceptable, alternative available.
Combination of physical stock with a cash component
Over the years there has been much discussion in academic and certain donor circles of the benefit of holding the strategic grain reserve in the form of cash rather than physical stock. It is argued that with a "cash reserve", grain would only be purchased for reserve purposes in the event of a possible food emergency arising and that such an approach would be more cost effective than continuously maintaining a physical reserve. This approach assumes that grain will always be available on the international market at an affordable price, that the "cash reserve" will be available when required. These are both sweeping assumptions.
For most Sahelian and Sub-Saharan countries the grain which will need to be imported to combat a food emergency is white maize, a crop which is not normally readily available outside the region, and for which there is a relatively small international trade. As droughts are the main cause of food shortages for all countries in the region and as they tend to extend over several countries at a time, it is likely that several countries will be facing shortages of white maize at the same time. There is thus a strong possibility that prices for white maize will be high and/or that countries may put on export bans in an attempt to protect their own limited stocks. As the closest alternative to white maize, i.e. yellow maize, faces considerable consumer resistance a strong argument can be made for holding-over some stocks of white maize, in a reserve, from surplus production years until such time that it becomes clear that the country is unlikely to face a food shortage before the
next harvest. Such a move, however, has cost implications for the reserve, particularly if interest rates are high.
Although grain is a relatively low value commodity, as the quantities required to combat a food shortage are relatively large, usually several tens of thousands of tonnes, the size of the "cash reserve" required to arrange for purchases either on the domestic market or through imports will amount to several million US dollars. With most governments facing serious financial difficulties, neither their treasuries nor their politicians, while being prepared to accept the need to hold physical stocks of grain to a similar value, will willingly accept that substantial sums of money are being held by the reserve agency in a deposit account, against the possibility of a food emergency arising. There would therefore always be pressure to use the cash for other causes, particularly in years when there is no or little danger of a food emergency, only to find that when the cash is required the Treasury is unable to make it available when required for making purchases.
In an attempt to gain the best of both worlds consideration should be given to holding the reserve partially as a physical stock and partially as cash. The proportions of each could be adjusted each marketing year depending upon the likelihood of a food emergency arising in the coming marketing year. The greater the risk the higher would be the physical stock and vice versa. The total value, in dollar terms, of the reserve's physical stock and cash resources should not be affected by the relative proportions of each component, i.e. apart from transaction gains and losses, the real value, in US dollar terms, of the "grain account" should remain constant.
<section>c</section>
Location of the reserve
There is often a discussion as to whether it is better to hold physical stocks of grain in the area of production or in the area of consumption. From a pure cost point of view, it is cheaper to hold grain in the area of production rather than transfer it to areas of consumption. In this way the costs of transport and handling are kept to a minimum, only being incurred as and when it is clear that the grain will be required in a particular location. However, reality is rarely as theory would suggest. The reserve has to be held in locations where suitable facilities with adequate capacity for the long-term storage of significant quantities of grain exist. As a result of past marketing policies, which were heavily biased towards meeting the needs of the urban consumer, modern storage facilities, bag stores and/or silos, were often located in, or within easy reach of, the main urban areas. With market liberalisation many of these facilities will be increasingly under-utilised as
the storage pattern changes to take into account changed market conditions. For example: instead of grain being bought and put into stock by the parastatal at the beginning of the marketing year and then steadily released throughout the year, more grain will tend to remain on-farm, as producers try to benefit from the higher prices towards the end of the season. Storage demand by private traders is also likely to be low as they tend to operate on the basis of rapid stock turnover and small margins rather than purchase and store grain. Thus, while suitable storage capacity should not be a problem, the location of the reserve will be dictated in the first instance by the location of existing available storage facilities.
While there could be advantages to having the reserve spread across several locations consideration has to be given to maintaining control and supervision over the physical stocks. The more fragmented the reserve becomes through storage in different locations, the higher will be the cost for monitoring the integrity of the stock, and the greater will be the likely need for subsequent stock movements. This would appertain whether the reserve was administered by a parastatal or by a reserve agency. There could therefore be advantages to restricting the reserve to a few strategic locations which can be readily monitored and supervised. If it is intended to purchase and sell grain using a tendering system, it may also be more beneficial to locate the reserve close to areas where traders are active which will help ensure keen competition between traders. Several countries, e.g. Malawi and Zambia, want to provide some support to producers in the more remote or disadvantaged areas.
Although it is likely to increase the cost of grain purchase to the agency, there may be a case for locating a proportion of the reserve in such areas, provided that suitable storage facilities exist, to encourage traders to source grain in the area. Any additional cost for undertaking such inherently higher cost operations at the request of government should be charged separately to government, perhaps as a social charge.
<section>d</section>
Establishment of the reserve
Purchase of grain
Food aid
Establishment of the reserve requires either the provision of finance or the direct provision of grain e.g. from existing government owned stocks, or from donations of grain by donors. In the case of Zambia the reserve was initially established by the sequestration of stocks held by agents who were held to be in default of loan repayments to the government, while the Tanzanian government made resources and funds available to the Food Security Unit to reconstitute the reserve from domestic purchases. It is to be expected that whichever method, or combination of methods, is used, the reserve will not be fully resourced, either in terms of cash or stocks, from the outset but rather be built-up progressively, as additional resources are made available by government or, perhaps, donors. Additional resources may be generated periodically from profitable sales of the reserve. However, these should be considered as windfalls rather than as a regular feature of a reserve which is
normally considered to be a cost centre, requiring periodic injections of cash, rather than a profit centre. Thus, for the first few years of operation, the purchases are likely to be limited not by the size of the reserve required but rather by the finance available to purchase grain.
Purchase of grain
A prime concern for the management and operation of a strategic grain reserve should be ensuring that transactions undertaken in connection with the reserve have as little effect on the orderly functioning of the grain market as possible. In addition, transactions should be undertaken in such a manner that private traders recognise that, rather than serving as a threat, the reserve can complement their activities by providing additional resources in times of shortages. Thus, procedures for purchasing grain which allow for private sector participation are likely to be more successful in averting its concerns with respect to the reserve and engendering a spirit of cooperation than those in which the reserve and traders are in direct competition.
In deciding which would be the most appropriate method for purchasing grain for the reserve it should be recognised that, under free market conditions, neither a parastatal nor an institutional agency has the flexibility which individual traders have, to react instantaneously to movements in commodity markets. Thus, in a competitive trading situation, it is the trader who will normally be able to out-perform an institution.
Options which could be considered for the purchase of grain include: direct purchase, either at the prevailing market or at a support price; using appointed agents and through public open tendering. As parastatals are normally also grain traders in their own right, it would be normal to expect that they would choose to use their own resources for purchasing grain for the reserve, either through their established buying points and/or at their depot locations. However, consideration could be given to requiring the parastatal to formerly involve private sector traders to supply a proportion of grain required for the reserve either acting as agents or through open public tender.
Specialist reserve agencies are not regular purchasers in the market, as are normal traders, but only enter the market occasionally, normally immediately after harvest, to make purchases to replenish the reserve. Under these circumstances it is unlikely to be economic for an agency to set up the structures necessary to purchase its requirements directly in the market in parallel, or competition, with established traders. It would normally be preferable for the agency to either appoint agents to purchase grain on its behalf or use a tendering system. Both systems avoid the need of an agency having to establish and staff its own purchasing structure, which would only be required infrequently, while they both try to harness the skills and energy of the private sector to supply the quantities required. By using existing market participants in their normal marketing roles they do not distort the normal functioning of the market, except for increasing demand.
Using agents to purchase grain for the reserve, who are also traders in their own right, is vulnerable to malpractice. Quite naturally agents will tend to reserve the best qualities of grain for their own transactions with the poorer qualities of grain, which may well still be within the specification, being offered to the reserve. With no means of proving the actual purchase price paid, it is probable that the reserve will be overcharged for the grain supplied. A tendering system offers the likelihood of increased competition between traders for the supply of specific quantities of grain of a specified quality to nominated locations. As such the prices quoted are more likely to reflect the prevailing market price. There is a likelihood, however, that traders, not used to the discipline of contracts, may tend to default when they find they are unable to fulfil their obligations, or when they find an alternative customer willing to pay a higher price. To minimise such risks
consideration could be given to requiring a performance bond redeemable only on satisfactory completion of the contract. The tendering system has already been adopted as the standard procedure for the purchase of grain for the reserve in Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia. The reserve needs to recognise that, initially at least, many of the traders operating in the grain market and wanting to supply the reserve are relatively small businessmen, with limited working capital. As such they may not be in a position to extend credit to the reserve agency for the full value of their contract. The possibility of making stage payments, say after the delivery of a specified quantity, is recommended.
In addition to the purchase of grain on the domestic market for the reserve, there may be a need to consider purchases of grain on the international market. This would be particularly the case when the severity of a crop failure puts pressure on grain prices early in the marketing year. Under such circumstances trying to make significant purchases in the domestic market may well cause prices to rise even faster. The extent to which the reserve agency would need to enter the international market would, in turn, depend on the extent to which the market has been liberalised and the private sector encouraged to import directly on its own account to make good any market shortfall. However, as the private sector will not want to over-import, because of the lowering effect it would have on market prices, the agency responsible for the reserve will need to take a cautious position and ensure that it has sufficient stocks to meet any perceived shortfall in private sector grain
imports. To assist in the determination of this "import gap", i.e. the difference between the perceived import requirements and the provision made by the private sector, it may be desirable to require importers to register the quantities they have arranged to import to enable the total import provision to be calculated. The total confirmed import quantity could also be made available to the private sector to help them in their decision making processes.
Apart from concerns over not wanting to over-import other constraints may limit the private sector's ability, or willingness to import. These include: difficulties in gaining access to foreign exchange for the purchase, lack of experience in importing substantial quantities, small scale of operation of many private sector traders and concerns over possible government interventions. Under such circumstances, the government may wish to provide some support to the private sector to their mutual advantage. This could be undertaken for example by the government acting as an intermediate importer, i.e. arranging for the import of grain and then selling it off to traders in smaller, more manageable, lots^1 The price charged for the grain should carry a premium so that traders who import directly have some commercial advantage and the government does not import at a loss. Alternatively, the government may enter into arrangements with the commercial banks to underwrite part of the
loans made to finance grain imports.
^1 For example the government could make arrangements for the import of 20,000 tonnes of grain and then sell it off in 1,000 tonne lots to millers/traders
In the event that there still remains an "import gap" the reserve, if it does not hold sufficient stocks to cover the gap, may need to enter the international market to buy the required quantities for crediting to the reserve, where it would be used in the same manner as other grains held. This is a less desirable option than encouraging private sector imports, or selling imported grain to traders in lots on arrival, as the government would have to finance the cost of the grain until it was finally marketed, which could be several months later. It is therefore in the government's direct financial interest to set the climate for encouraging private sector imports.
A more advanced option which could also be considered by reserve agency/government is the use of other financial instruments for covering all, or part, of the import needs. These are the use of futures and options for either hedging positions or providing a form of insurance, Appendix 2. However, a word of caution is required if the use of such instruments is being considered. While they can be of considerable assistance in lowering costs in a commodity market, they can also lead to substantial financial losses if not used properly. To take advantage of such systems a detailed knowledge and experience of the international market is essential. As in most countries this expertise is not readily available, agencies considering using these, or similar, instruments should seek the advice of a reputable trading house or broker^1

c) Grain provided is often of a poor quality and likely to attract a lower price on the market
Food aid
In the years when regulated markets were the norm food aid destined for market operations was usually channelled through parastatal grain agencies The grain was normally sold into the market at the prevailing official price, usually heavily subsidised, with the revenues so generated often being absorbed by the parastatals to help cover their losses In addition to handling the marketed food aid, the parastatals were also often used as conduits for channelling food aid in support of relief operations to NGOs or government agencies
With the transition to liberalised markets far more care is required with respect to the manner in which food aid is released into the market to ensure that it does not distort normal market operations or undermine the confidence of private sector traders There are essentially two options open to government for minimising these risks The first is to absorb the food aid which is to be monetised into the strategic grain reserve, where it would be treated as a normal part of the reserve stocks, and the second is to treat it as a commercial import undertaken by government with the grain being sold progressively into the market Sales into the market, are particularly useful when the grain is either not of the type usually held in the reserve, e g yellow maize or wheat rather than white maize, or if its storage life is limited By generating cash from the sale the required type of grain for the reserve can be purchased.
Due consideration should be given to the method of sale and the price at which the grain is sold To avoid depressing the market at a time when prices are already low, i.e. just after harvest, sales should preferably be made, at market prices, towards the end of the marketing year when prices start to rise This would also serve to maximise the revenue generated Because the grain was either a donation or supplied on concessionary terms, the temptation to sell it at prices below the prevailing market price should be avoided This would either serve to disrupt the market and undermine trader confidence or provide traders with an ideal opportunity for making excessive profit at the expense of the government Care should also be taken when releasing such grain into the market that existing import positions of traders are not compromised. Ideally food aid sales should be made at prices which are in excess of the prevailing import parity price for the particular location. To avoid
misunderstandings government should also keep private traders fully advised of any planned arrival of food aid shipments and of the manner in which they are to be used. This will help the private sector adjust its market position to take account of the likely impact that the additional quantities of grain will have on the market.

Financing the reserve
As the strategic grain reserve is owned by the government, it must ultimately be the government which finances the cost of establishing and maintaining the reserve. From the outset it should be recognised, and accepted by government, that the reserve is likely to be a continuing cost burden, and should not be expected to generate sufficient funds from the sales of grain to cover either its replenishment or its full operating costs. The scale of the costs involved will be related to the size of the reserve and the obligations for social programmes. For those countries where the majority of releases will be for meeting shortfalls in market availabilities, e.g. Zambia, the cost to government is likely to be proportionately lower than for countries which have a high rural vulnerability to food insecurity combined with low purchasing power, thereby necessitating increased use of relief programmes, e.g. Malawi. The management and operational structure of the reserve will also have
a bearing on its costs.
Costs attributable to the reserve are likely to increase when:
- the reserve agency is responsible for maintaining and operating the storage facilities used for holding the reserve, e.g. recurrent staffing and building costs will be incurred irrespective of the quantity of grain held in the reserve;
- the reserve agency is responsible for maintaining the physical stocks held in the reserve;
- the reserve comprises several different types of grain, i.e. some grains will be more expensive than others, and higher administrative, handling and transport costs are incurred, e.g. various grain types have to be allocated to different locations where they will be required;
- purchases for and sales from the reserve are made directly by the reserve agency, as the reserve agency will need to establish and maintain the capacity for undertaking such actions, which are only required intermittently;
- the reserve agency is required to undertake price stabilisation activities, particularly when the price band is narrower than that formed by import and export parity prices, as it cannot take full advantage of the low market prices when it is buying grain and the high market prices when it is selling;
- the reserve agency is also responsible for monitoring market conditions and providing market intelligence activities.
whereas costs are likely to decrease when:
- other government agencies are responsible for monitoring market conditions, e.g. Early Warning Unit and Market Information, and/or Market Intelligence, Systems.
- the storage and maintenance of the reserve is contracted out either to public or to private sector companies, as the agency would only be required to pay for the storage and maintenance of the grain actually held. The private sector company could use the "spare" capacity for storing other commodities either on its own account or under contract for other traders;
- the reserve comprises a single, locally available grain
- purchases and sales are made using the facilities and resources of the private sector, i.e. buying and selling by public open tender or through appointed private sector agents or using commodity exchange;
- reserve respects import and export parity prices, i.e. it does not attempt to maintain producer and consumer prices within a band narrower than the import/export parity price band.
Finance will be required to fund the purchase of grain and to cover operational costs, i.e. administrative costs of the agency responsible for the reserve, storage, handling, transport and maintenance costs of the grain. While the funds used for purchasing grain will be regenerated, either in total or partially^1, when the grain is marketed, operational costs are a non-recoverable expenditure and therefore need to be strictly controlled. In the interests of greater transparency and acceptability there are advantages to be gained if a separation is made between the funds use for grain purchase, i.e. the grain account, from those used for paying for operational activities, i.e. the operational account. Such a separation would also reduce the opportunity, and temptation, to pay for administrative costs from the revenues generated from grain sales.
^1 In those countries which have a large difference between import and export parity prices, i.e. landlocked countries such as Malawi and Zambia, the funds generated from the sale of the reserve could, if advantageously made, yield a profit.
To enable the reserve agency to function efficiently it would be preferable if all financial resources attributable to the reserve, i.e. those from the grain and operational accounts, were held and managed directly by the reserve agency. This would enable the reserve to enter the market, domestic or international, for grain purchase without having to go through the time-consuming bureaucratic machinery of requesting funds, or permission to spend funds held, from the Treasury. As a safeguard the funds trusted to the agency should be subject to an annual audit and the reserve management be held accountable for the correctness of their use. To allay fears that the reserve is in some way benefiting from preferential treatment, such audits could be made available for inspection by interested parties, e.g. a grain traders' association.
Options available for the establishing, and maintaining the grain and operational accounts are:
- a direct allocation of funds from the Treasury to the grain account to meet the initial estimated cost for the establishment of the reserve. This could be a single lump sum or tranches over a period of say 3-4 years. Tranch payments would enable government to verify that an acceptable level of propriety in the use of the funds was being maintained before committing the full funding requirements. Disadvantages of tranch payments are: the size of the reserve will be constrained by the availability of financial resources during the build-up period, and government may lose its initial enthusiasm for making subsequent tranch payments into the reserve, particularly if the likelihood of a food emergency is low;
- access to loan funds from a commercial bank which would be charged at the prevailing interest rate for the purchase of grain stocks. This presupposes that the reserve will be able to recover the interest charges and storage costs from the revenues generated when the grain is sold. However, in many countries the process of structural adjustment has led to exceptionally high commercial rates of interest, which could result in the reserve agency being unable to service the loan in full from funds generated by the sale of grain. Under these circumstances the government will need to cover the difference through annual cash injections based on the audited accounts;
- it would be advantageous if the non-recoverable operational costs, e.g. salaries and overhead costs of the reserve agency, were to be covered separately through an annual payment from government to the reserve agency;
- sales of grain, either from transfers of stock already held by government, as was the case for the establishment of the Zambian food security reserve, or from food aid donations.
Based on an estimate of its funding requirements and the resources it already commands, the agency should be required to prepare annually a detailed set of accounts for the reserve for independent auditing. It should also submit, according to established procedures, a budget request to government for any additional funding requirements for both the grain and the operational accounts. These requests would then be considered by government along with the demands of other departments on the Treasury. The activities of the reserve would then have to be constrained to the total resources available.
If funds are to be held by the Treasury, rather than by the reserve agency, procedures will need to be developed to enable the reserve to gain ready access to the needed resources as and when required. The cost of delaying transactions, or prevaricating over the release of funds, as treasuries in many countries are wont to do, can result in additional costs and/or penalties for the reserve as opportunities to take advantage of particular market circumstances are lost.
While the reserve is likely to be used for the most part to cope with market shortfalls, there will be occasions when it has to be used for relief programmes for those groups who do not have the necessary resources to purchase their requirements in the market. In these instances grain will usually be released for distribution through a food for work or a special feeding programme. Unlike releases from the reserve for sale in the market, which can be triggered by predetermined factors, releases for relief programmes need to be decided on a case-by-case basis. As such programmes are of a social nature, and therefore have to be supported financially, they will need to be authorised by government, and charged to the appropriate government department. To maintain the integrity of the reserve, government must therefore be prepared to make the funds available to cover the cost of the grain to be withdrawn from the reserve. Ideally the price paid for the grain should reflect its
market value at the time of its withdrawal. However, this may lead to accusations from political sources that the reserve is exploiting a situation involving human suffering. As a possible lower cost alternative, consideration could be given to charging the total costs incurred to date for the purchase, handling and storage of the grain to be released. This would enable the reserve agency to recoup the direct costs it has incurred. It should be recognised, however, that these incurred costs for the reserve could be higher than the prevailing market price for grain.

The need for operational procedures
Under the conditions prevailing in formerly regulated markets, two differing approaches were adopted for the operation of a strategic grain reserve. The first involved treating it as a buffer, or minimum level of stock, used for normal market operations of the parastatal grain agency. As such the reserve would be drawn upon automatically, once the operational stocks were exhausted, to maintain market operations. Subsequently, when purchases were made, the reserve was automatically replenished as the stocks were built-up. This approach tended to be favoured by those countries which could regularly expect to be in surplus and were therefore able to maintain the (flexible) reserve from their own resources, e.g. Kenya and Zimbabwe.
The second approach involved maintaining the reserve as a separately identifiable stock, which could only be drawn on if certain conditions were met, e.g. official recognition of an approaching food emergency and/or a formal sanctioning for the release of grain. This approach tended to be adopted by those countries which regularly faced crop shortfalls and were reliant on donor support for maintaining the reserve^1 e.g. Ethiopia, and Tanzania. A specialist entity, e.g. a Food Security Unit, was normally established to administer the reserve. Although it was intended that the reserve should be kept separately identifiable, as it was normally held under a contractual arrangement with the parastatal grain agency in the same facilities as the operational stock, there was a strong temptation for the reserve to be considered by the parastatal management more as a buffer stock for supplementing shortfalls in the availability of operational stock. Thus, while there may have been
specified formalities and procedures before grain could be released from the reserve, these tended to be overlooked with, in practice, the parastatal agency using some or all of the reserve for bolstering its normal marketing operations. As prices did not reflect costs incurred, and usually contained a high element of subsidy, the money generated from the sale of the grain from the reserve was insufficient to finance its replenishment. As a result the size of the reserve steadily diminished, eventually becoming exhausted. Such situations could have been avoided had clearly defined operational procedures been available for each operation and strictly adhered to.
^1 By maintaining a separate identity for the reserve the donor community could be assured that the reserve was only being used for the intended purpose of relieving suffering during a food emergency.
The importance of standard operational procedures increases substantially with the introduction of market liberalisation. The existence of a large stock of grain under the ultimate control of a government, which has a history of market intervention and repressing private initiative, could be seen by private sector traders as a potential threat to their market activities and thus their willingness to make investments, other than short-term, in the market. To avert any residual apprehension that the reserve could be used as a tool of government to manipulate the market, there needs to be transparency in the manner in which operational decisions relating to the strategic grain reserve are taken and a general understanding, and acceptance, of the manner in which those decisions will be implemented. The greater the opacity of operational actions concerning the reserve and/or the greater any divergencies or inconsistencies in applying declared procedures, the more cautious and
distrustful will private traders be of the government.
Ethiopia Operational Procedures
for the Food Security Reserve
The Ethiopian, food security reserve was established under the umbrella the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission rather than with the parastatal Agricultural Marketing Corporation, which had the monopoly for grain marketing. The reserve was administered en a day-to-day basis by a semi-autonomous Food Security Unit which was responsible for taking management and operational decisions relative to the maintenance or the reserve. Operational authorities and responsibilities were formally specific e.g. releases from the reserve, other than for normal stock rotation, required the declaration of a "food emergency" and the approval of the high level Food Security Committee, comprising representatives from the ministries of Domestic Trade, Finance and Agriculture, Once the release was sanctioned by the committee the Food Security Unit was responsible for releasing the grain in accordance with the authority received.
Both government and private sector participants need to recognise that there are significant advantages to both sides from having clearly designated procedures which specify how, and under what conditions, operational decisions relating to the reserve will be taken and implemented. For example:
- the agency responsible for managing the reserve can be held more accountable for its actions. This is likely to result in less abuse in the use and operation of the reserve;
- the private sector will be fully aware of the circumstances and manner in which the reserve will be used. This should encourage them to assume, with confidence, an increased role in the marketing of grain, particularly if they are to be involved in some of the reserve operations, e.g. purchasing and storing grain;
- aggrieved parties in the private sector have the opportunity of taking government to task if laid-down operational procedures are circumvented;
- government will find it more difficult to countermand operational procedures which have been established, for expediency or to gain political advantage;
- with greater private sector confidence and involvement the difference between market needs and the provision made by the private sector will be narrowed. This would, in turn, reduce the size of reserve the government needs to maintain to achieve a particular level of security.
To avoid any confusion or misunderstandings of what the established procedures are, it is useful to prepare, preferably in consultation with representatives of the private sector traders, an operational manual which provides a comprehensive set of procedures to be employed for undertaking the various actions concerned with the management and operation of the reserve. Such a manual would describe:
- the structure, authority and responsibilities of any committees or governing bodies of agencies associated with the operation and maintenance of the reserve;
- the structure authority and responsibilities of the agency responsible for administering the reserve;
- general information relating to the ownership and purpose of the reserve, its size and location and financial arrangements;
- conditions for triggering releases of grain from the reserve for various activities;
- procedures for
- release of grain from the reserve
- procurement of grain for the reserve
- storage of grain in the reserve
- recycling grain in the reserve
- quality control
- financing strategic grain reserve operations.
Individual pages in the manual would describe the various responsibilities and authorities and provide details of the procedures to be followed. Appendix 3 provides examples from a procedural manual prepared by FAO for the Ethiopian Food Security Unit in 1990.
Management
The manner in which the reserve is managed and operated varies depending on the organisational structure adopted. In practice the choice lies between a government department, a specialised institutional entity, e.g. a reserve agency, whose sole responsibility, with respect to grain handling, is the management of the reserve, and a public or private sector organisation which, inter alia, also engages in commercial grain marketing activities. While all these would be ultimately responsible to government for the management of the reserve, a government department and a specialised agency would normally be expected to enjoy greater autonomy and decision making authority, through their own governing boards or committees, over the management and operation of the reserve. This is because a parastatal, or private sector company, can be subject to conflicts of interest between its reserve responsibilities and its commercial activities. Whichever structure is adopted, however, there is
a need to clearly specify, preferably in an Operational Procedures Manual, the responsibilities and authorities for each level of authority having responsibilities for supervising, managing and operating the reserve.
The following table suggests the type of decision authority which could be vested in the entity responsible for the reserve. As a general principle government departments and reserve agencies, because they are, or have close links to, the public sector, could be given responsibility for both managerial and operational decisions. The only exception should be those decisions resulting in additional costs to government. In these instances the decision should be taken in the responsible department of government, e.g. Office of the Prime Minister (Tanzania, for relief requirements), Office of the Vice President (Zambia, for relief requirements). The decision making authority for parastatal or private sector organisations responsible for the reserve should be restricted to purely operational activities with decisions outside this area being made by the government body responsible for policy matters related to the reserve. Examples of decision making authority which could or should
not be vested in the different types of agency responsible for the reserve are shown below.

Storage
The storage requirements for grain held in the reserve differ from those for operational stocks of grain. The main difference is the inherent requirement for reserve stocks to be held for prolonged periods, which sometimes may even extend into the following marketing year. Commercial grain stocks, however, tend to be turned-over rapidly on a continuing basis, and would normally be expected to be exhausted by the end of the marketing year. While, under a regulated market there may have been significant carryover stocks in public sector storage following a surplus crop year^1 with market liberalisation there will be an increasing tendency for producers to hold grain on-farm for sale later in the season. This trend will be driven in part by their expectation of higher prices, but also by the reluctance of the private sector to invest in long-term stocks, particularly when interest rates are high. Private sector traders prefer instead to work on the basis of small margins and
rapid stock turn-over which reduces the need for commercial storage. Only large-scale commercial mills will have an interest in maintaining stocks, or in having access to stocks, to ensure that their mills can continue to operate economically. As a result under liberalised market conditions the demand for commercial storage can be expected to be lower.
^1 With pan-territorial and pan-temporal pricing systems in place there was no incentive for producers to retain surplus grain on-farm. Thus, most marketable grain was sold to the parastatal in the period following harvest. In a surplus year, and without adequate exports, the parastatal would be left with large carry-over stocks.
Because of its requirement for long-term storage the reserve will need to be housed in modern warehouse or silo type facilities which are suitable for holding grain for prolonged periods under the prevailing climatic conditions. In most countries of the Sahelian and Sub-Saharan regions such storage facilities were usually government owned and under the control of the parastatal grain agency and/or public sector milling companies. With market liberalisation the ownership and control of the facilities often remains within the public sector unless special action has been taken. For example in Zambia, following the demise of the parastatal Namboard, the grain storage facilities have been transferred to the newly created Food Reserve Agency which is responsible for renting, or leasing, them out to the private sector, rather than operating them directly. Similarly, in Tanzania storage facilities have been transferred to the Food Security Department for holding the reserve. In this
instance, however, the facilities required for the reserve are being managed directly by the Department with the surplus stores being rented out to the private sector. When stores are rented out to the private sector, unless it is specified in the contractual arrangements, there is a strong likelihood that they will be used for the storage of other non-grain, and even non-agricultural, products. Available large-scale storage capacity for grain may therefore decline.
There are two basic options open to the agency responsible for the reserve for storing grain. The first involves the agency managing the stocks itself, using storage facilities it either owns or otherwise has access to. For a parastatal, or commercial enterprise, charged with managing the reserve the staffing and technical expertise should be readily available from its commercial activities and would not need to be expanded. However, for government department or an institutional reserve agency this would involve the appointment of staff to manage and operate the storage facilities purely for maintaining the reserve. The second option, which is applicable to both a government department and an institutional reserve agency, would involve contracting-out the storage of the reserve to either a public or private sector organisation with access to suitable storage facilities and expertise in grain storage. This option would remove the need for establishing the capacity for direct
day-to-day management of the grain stocks. It is also likely to be the lower cost option as the agency would only be required to pay for the actual storage capacity used on a cost per tonne per month basis, rather than having to bear the total cost, whatever the capacity used, if it owned and operated the facilities itself. This would be particularly relevant in those countries which vary the size of the physical stock held in the reserve each year, depending on the perceived risk of a shortfall occurring, and therefore the annual storage capacity requirements. If the preferred option is to own and operate the storage facilities directly arrangements will need to be made for transferring ownership, or responsibility, for the required storage facilities to the reserve agency. As the private sector and parastatal grain organisations, once they start to operate commercially, are not likely to want to hold large stocks of grain over prolonged periods, the stock of potentially
suitable and underutilised storage facilities owned by government is likely to be in excess of nominal storage requirements for the reserve. The reserve agency therefore has a degree of choice in deciding which facilities should be taken-over for holding the reserve. Preference should be given to those with good transport access and which are conveniently located, from the point of view of grain purchase and release. They should be in good structural condition and not subject to rainwater leaks or ingress to birds and rodent pests. While there should be adequate ventilation, the facilities need to be suitable for undertaking periodic fumigation to control insect pests. Unless facilities can meet with the standards required the reserve agency should be cautious about accepting responsibility for them, as there will be no recourse if grain is damaged during storage due to the poor condition of the storage facilities.

From a cost point of view it is normally advantageous to hold the reserve in relatively few key locations rather than spread thinly across many locations in an attempt to provide national coverage. The Food Security Department in Tanzania, which directly manages its own stores, initially had the reserve spread over 13 locations. Total storage capacity was some 193,000 tonnes, while the target size of the reserve was 100,000 tonnes. This has since been reduced to 7 locations with a total capacity of 163,000 tonnes. In addition to simplifying the operational management of the reserve it has led to significant cost savings.
A decision to operate storage facilities directly will involve the reserve agency in employing the staff necessary to look after and maintain the grain. As grain handling and maintenance activities only take place intermittently, for most of the time there will be little or no work for the staff to do. While manual labour, for bag handling etc., can be employed on a casual basis as required, there will be a need to maintain a small permanent staff at each facility, e.g. a manager and technical, administration and security staff. This will represent a continuing cost to the reserve, irrespective of whether any grain is held or not. In addition the agency will be directly responsible for the maintenance cost of the facilities. Contracting-out grain storage offers the reserve agency potentially more flexibility in selecting the location in which to hold the grain and to vary the capacity, both of which could change from year-to-year depending on market conditions. The agency
would also only be liable to pay for the storage facilities used. While storage costs charged may appear to be relatively high it has to be remembered that the agency would not incur any direct costs with respect to storage. It would, however, be prudent to appoint inspectors to monitor, on a regular basis, the integrity of the stock, its quality and to supervise movements of stock into and out of the reserve. Particular attention will need to be given to ensuring that the grain for the reserve is separately identified from commercial stocks of grain, and during stock recycling to ensure that any exchanges between the reserve and the commercial stocks are undertaken correctly.

Whether the stocks are held in own operated or contracted facilities the operational procedures to be followed should be clearly specified in an Operational Procedures Manual, Appendix 3. Examples of procedures which should be incorporated in the manual include:
- authorisations required for various actions related to the reserve;
- stockcards to be used for recording additions to, or deletions from, each stockpile, bin or silo with the resultant quantity stored and any treatments or other actions undertaken;
- grain procurement;
- receiving grain into the reserve and releasing grain from the reserve;
- rotating the reserve;
- quality monitoring, stock and pest management;
- disposal of sub-standard and/or damaged grain.
Stock maintenance and quality control
Whenever grain is stored for a prolonged period it will need to be inspected periodically to ensure that its condition remains within specification and that it is not subject to pest or rodent attack. The frequency with which such inspections need to be undertaken will depend on the climatic conditions and the method of storage employed; e.g. in bags, on-floor bulk, bins or silos. As in most countries the market is dominated by sales in bags, it is to be expected that the most common method of storage will be in bags. The scope of these periodic inspections should include an examination of the storage facilities to ensure that they are in a sound condition as well as of the stockpiles, storage bins or silo cells to ensure that the grain is correctly stored and identified, e.g. properly labelled with quantities and actions taken recorded on the stock cards. Representative samples of grain should also be taken periodically for analysis.
Responsibility for inspections, and undertaking the necessary corrective action, would, in the first instance rest with the agency responsible for the physical storage of the grain. That would be either the reserve agency itself, had it opted for the direct storage and management of the reserve or, the contracted storage organisation, in the case that responsibility for storing the reserve had been contracted out. In this instance the reserve agency should retain the right to undertake independent surprise inspections at each storage location to ensure that contractual obligations are being adhered to and that the integrity and quality of the grain is being satisfactorily maintained. These inspectors, in addition to undertaking a visual inspection of the storage facilities and grain will also need to take samples for testing to ensure that the quality remains at a satisfactory level. The reserve agency may need to establish an independent capability for testing grain quality
itself rather than rely on laboratories situated in the storage facilities. Alternatively, independent testing laboratories could be used. In some countries there may be a general lack of technical expertise, or technical capacity, with respect to quality control and pest management amongst those organisations, including parastatal grain agencies, which operate suitable storage facilities. In these instances it may be necessary for the reserve agency to establish and operate mobile teams of technically competent staff to visit each location on a regular basis to inspect the grain held in the reserve and take any necessary corrective measures directly, e.g. fumigation of infested grain. This could also be made available as a service to other organisations on a contractual basis. Such a capacity was established within the Ethiopian Food Security Unit and their pest management services were frequently called upon by NGOs to treat grain held in their stores.
Should inspections reveal that the condition of the grain has deteriorated below an acceptable level, corrective action will need to be taken, e.g. improving ventilation for bagged grain, or aeration for grain stored in bulk to control moisture levels, and/or fumigation if the grain is found to be contaminated with insect pests. If it is uneconomic to recondition the grain, arrangements will need to be made for its disposal. This would normally be done by sale, using procedures similar to those used when stocks are recycled or sold into the market. As the reason for sale is quality loss the price realised would be below the prevailing market price, thereby resulting in a financial loss for the reserve. Responsibility for any losses incurred should be subject to a formal investigation and, if found to be due to the neglect of the organisation responsible for the storage and maintenance of the grain, consideration should be given to imposing a financial penalty on the
organisation concerned, or entering into litigation.
Procurement
The quantities which can be purchased for the reserve will depend on the funds available and the average price per tonne which has to be paid. To maximise the quantity purchased for a given level of funding, procurement efforts would normally be concentrated in the period immediately following harvest in the main surplus producing areas when market prices can be expected to be at their lowest. Purchases during this period could also have the beneficial effect of increasing demand, and thereby provide some support to producer prices at a time when market prices are low. However, depending on market availabilities and sensitivity to changes in demand, it may also be desirable to spread purchases out over a period of one to two months to avoid putting a large demand on the market for a short period of time, and thereby risk causing price instability.
While purchasing directly from farmers holds certain emotive attractions, it has substantial practical and operational problems. With the majority of farmers in most countries having relatively small holdings the quantities each would be able to offer for sale at a time would also be correspondingly low. As an extreme example, until the 1996 season ADMARC in Malawi was prepared to buy, for social reasons, quantities as small as a few kilograms from individual small farmers at each of its approximately 1,000 buying points. To avoid having several tens of thousands of individual transactions each for relatively small quantities consideration needs to be given to introducing a minimum quantity which would be bought at a buying point, or storage location. While in remote rural areas this could be as low as one tonne, larger depots should consider having a minimum quantity of at least ten tonnes. The advantages of introducing a minimum quantity include:
- a significant reduction in the number of individual transactions undertaken to purchase a given quantity of grain;
- increased opportunity to monitor and control the quality of grain purchased for the reserve;
- reduced handling and other transaction costs;
- providing a market opportunity for small-scale private traders to assemble grain into acceptable sized lots for sale to the reserve.
While a parastatal having a commercial grain marketing activity as well as a responsibility for the strategic grain reserve might be able to maintain a network of buying points throughout the country, it is unlikely that a reserve agency without a commercial marketing arm would be able to justify the creation of a procurement network for replenishing the reserve. Even parastatal agencies, as they move, or are pushed, into adopting more commercial practices should undertake a review of the cost of maintaining each buying point against the revenue it generates. In many instances it will be found that, from a commercial standpoint, a significant proportion of the network built-up during days of regulation and monopoly cannot be supported commercially, and should be closed.
As an alternative to maintaining a network of buying points, purchases could be restricted to those storage facilities in which the reserve is to be held. Producers and/or traders would be required to bring their grain to the storage facility where, provided it met minimum quantity and quality requirements, would be purchased at the prevailing purchase price. It should be borne in mind that in buying grain for the reserve it is intended to hold it in store at least until the lean season begins, and maybe even carry it over to the following year. Under these circumstances, and unlike buying grain for the commercial market, grain which falls below the specified minimum quality should not be bought, even at a discounted price for the reserve. Purchase prices may be related to the prevailing market price, or some kind of floor price, e.g. export parity price.
If the reserve is also being used in a price stabilisation role due consideration needs to be given to the manner in which price stabilisation will operate as far as producers are concerned. In a free market it is not the intention of producer price support to ensure that all farmers receive at least the floor price for their grain. This would require that the agency responsible maintains a comprehensive network of purchasing points throughout the country to be able to support the floor price for every farmer in the event that the market price falls below the floor price. This is unrealistic. From a practical standpoint the floor price should be offered at a few key locations. The more locations there are the more likely it will be that the natural price differential between different locations, which is an essential feature of all free markets, will be distorted. This would send wrong signals to farmers on what to produce and, as the opportunities for arbitrage are reduced,
deter traders from operating in the market. It can be expected, however, that there will be pressure put on the agency from political quarters when prices are low to increase the number of points at which the floor price is maintained. Such pressures need to be resisted as they will only serve to distort the natural market price, unless the floor price is lower than the export parity price. This is considered to be an unlikely situation. Care also needs to be taken to avoid producer price support being used as a euphemism for "buyer of last resort", where the reserve agency has an open ended commitment to purchase all quantities of grain offered at the floor price.
The agency should only be required to buy up to the quantity needed for the reserve. Quantities purchased in excess of this requirement could create problems in the future. For example the years in which the agency would be required to buy large quantities would be surplus years, i.e. when the market price is low. These are the very years when the reserve is least likely to be required. The agency would thus be left with stocks of grain which it is will probably have to sell at a loss in either the domestic or the export market or have to carry-over into the following season.
In theory the use of appointed agents to buy on behalf of the reserve offers the advantage that the reserve agency does not have to establish an infrastructure for purchasing grain but rather can receive it at nominated storage locations, where it would need to be checked in terms of quality and quantity before acceptance. Problems arise, however, from the natural tendency of the trader to keep the best quality for his own transactions, and from difficulties concerning the price to be paid for the grain. If a fixed price is agreed, e.g. floor price, it is possible that the agent will find more profitable outlets for the grain, while if a prevailing market price is used the agency has no control over the price actually paid by the agent. As the agents are generally relatively small business undertakings, they are usually short of working capital.

Delivery Location
Deliveries may be made to the following SGR Depot locations. Tender bids should specie locations to which maize would be delivered: Lilongwe, Salima, Balaka, Luchenza, Limbe, Mzuzu, Kazomba and Chilumba.
Delivery Schedules:
All deliveries are to be made by August 23, 1996 Tender bids should indicate is which time periods maize would be delivered: July 1-July 12; July 15-July 26 July 29-August 9; August la-August 23....
Opting of Bids:
All bids will be opened in the presence of those bidders who choose to be present at 1500 hours on 21 June 1996 at tae offices of the Malawi Government Central tender Board, Kirkcaldy House, Livingstone Avenue, Limbe. The Malawi government reserves the right to reject or accept the lowest bids.
Perhaps the most interesting of methods for purchasing grain is through contracts. These can either be contracts negotiated directly with a trader or contracts resulting from a successful bid in an open public tender. Both types of contract would be for the supply of an agreed quantity of grain of a specified quality to be delivered to a nominated location within a stated time-frame for an agreed price. Open public tender offers the advantage of transparency and avoids the risk of accusations of unfair competition and collusion between the reserve agency and the contractor as could be the case when direct contracts are negotiated. Open public tenders would normally be floated by the reserve agency through an advertisement in the press inviting bids. The advertisement should contain the basic information relating to the quantities and qualities required, the locations to which it should be delivered and the general conditions appertaining to the bid e.g. availability of
bidding documents, submission dates, opening time of bids and any performance bond requirements. To avoid misunderstandings it is preferable if bidders are required to submit their bids on pre-printed forms available from the agency or its appointed agents.
Whether the agency responsible for the reserve is also responsible for the management and operation of the storage facilities in which the grain is to be held or not, the agency is responsible for ensuring that the grain purchased is of an acceptable quality and that the quantities are correct. Prior to acceptance, samples need to be taken for testing in the laboratories of the storage facility to ensure that the grain meets the required quality specification. The results of each test along with the seller's identity should be recorded and be available for inspection.
If storage of the grain has been contracted out the reserve agency will be responsible for ensuring that the operational procedures set-out in the contractual document, or in an operational procedures manual are being adhered to. As the agency is ultimately responsible for paying for the purchase of the grain, it would be advisable to have inspectors present on-site to supervise and authenticate each procurement transaction and accounts staff to maintain necessary records of the transaction and authorise payment. Once the grain has been accepted there will be a need to ensure that it is properly stored. When commercial stocks are also maintained at the same storage location there should be a physical separation and identification of the two classifications of grain.
In deficit production years there will be a need to supplement production either through imports or through a draw-down of stocks, either or both public or private. In the event that imports are required government, through the reserve, would normally be required to make good the difference between the total import requirements and import quantities arranged through the private sector, i.e. the import gap. In making arrangements for the import of grain the agency either purchases with the intention of crediting the stocks into the reserve or alternatively for sale, in total or in part, to private traders in acceptable lot sizes on arrival. The advantage of selling the grain on arrival is that the agency will not have to finance the cost of the import from the time of import until it is required in the market.
Recycling
To maintain the reserve in good condition it will be necessary to periodically rotate the grain which has not been required to meet a market shortfall or for relief programmes, and is still held in the reserve. While, under the prevailing climatic conditions, it may be possible to hold grain satisfactorily for longer than a single marketing year, it will, even under the best storage conditions, have suffered some deterioration as compared with fresh grain, e.g. shrivelling, which will lower its acceptability, and thus its price relative to fresh grain, in the marketplace. Therefore, unless there are overriding reasons for retaining the grain for longer than a season, e.g. crop forecasts indicating that there will be a shortfall in production, it would normally be advisable to rotate the residual stocks held in the reserve each year.
The opportune time for rotating the grain would be towards the end of the marketing year when availabilities in the market tend to be at their lowest and when there should also be a good indication of the crop prospects for the following year and thus the likely reserve needs. The options open for recycling grain are to:
- release the grain to be recycled to the appropriate government agency, or an NGO, for use in targeted relief programmes. To protect the integrity of the reserve, any such releases should be paid for in full at the prevailing market price at the time of release. Experience has shown that failure to recover the value of the grain at this time, particularly from government, is fraught with the danger that when payment is due, or the cash is required to purchase replenishment stocks, government is unable, or unwilling, to reimburse the reserve agency to value of the grain;
- release the grain for sale through the normal marketing channels at the prevailing market prices. To minimise any adverse impact that such releases could have on market prices the grain should be released progressively over a prolonged period, of say two-three months. The method of sale would normally follow that used for sales releases, i.e. either by open public tendering, by sale through a clearing house/commodity exchange or by direct sale from the storage facility at market prices. Appendix 4 provides an example of stock recycling through a commodity exchange. If it is to be sold at a price set by the reserve agency, the price should be in-line with the prevailing market prices and should also be high enough to at least cover the financial costs incurred in financing and maintaining the stock. If sales are to be made when market prices are below import parity levels, due consideration needs to be given to outstanding private sector import arrangements to assess the
likely implications. It would be counterproductive to discourage future private sector imports by the inappropriate timing of sales from the reserve;
- exchanging grain with the commercial stocks of a large trader, e.g. parastatal company. The grain to be recycled would be transferred to the account of a commercial trader against a guarantee for the supply of an equivalent amount of grain either from better quality existing commercial stocks or from market purchases following the coming harvest. There would need to be some mechanism agreed for valuing the grain to be recycled to enable an equitable calculation to be made of the quantity of replacement grain to be supplied, i.e. to take account of quality differences between the recycled and replacement grain and market price differences at the time of sale (high end of season prices) and replacement (low after harvest prices).
- export the grain. This option would normally only be considered when there is little likelihood of it being required the following season to meet market shortfalls. Unless the grain was bought at, or close to, the export parity price, there is a strong possibility that exporting grain will involve the agency in financial loss. This would be particularly the case for landlocked countries such as Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe where the high costs of transport have a major influence on both import and export parity prices This option should therefore only be considered when the signs that the coming harvest will be in surplus and that there will thus probably be little demand on the reserve in the coming year.
If the reserve is to be maintained at its desired level it is in the government's interest to obtain the highest price possible for the grain to be released into the market, and thereby reduce the cost of maintaining the reserve. The temptation to release the grain at prices significantly lower than the prevailing prices for social purposes, not only reduces the revenue the reserve will generate for sustaining itself, but it is also likely to antagonise private sector traders or, if sales are made through them, provide traders with the opportunity to make a windfall profits.
Responsibility for authorising stock rotation should be vested in the governing body of the agency responsible for the reserve, e.g. Food Security Committee, Board of Directors or of Trustees. The decision to rotate stocks would be based on technical recommendations made by the management team responsible for the reserve.
Releases
Releases from the reserve will normally be made to counteract shortfalls in market availabilities, usually signalled by high and/or rapidly rising prices, and for relief operations. To enable the reserve to fulfil its function mechanisms need to be in place for signalling the need to release grain to cope with market shortfalls or for relief operations. While various triggers for releasing grain can be devised for coping with market shortfalls, releases for relief purposes are more difficult to determine and should, because they involve a direct cost on government, be sanctioned by the government department responsible for relief programmes.
Typical triggers which could be used to initiate the process for releasing grain into the market are:
- when the market price at a key location rises above a predetermined value. To have the minimum negative impact on the functioning of the market this price level should be at least equivalent to the prevailing import parity price for the particular location. (As the import parity price is dependent on the international market price and the cost of transport to the concerned location it is also fluctuating according to international market conditions).
- when the market prices rise exceptionally rapidly over a two-three month period. The definition of exceptionally rapidly would depend on what is considered to be normal seasonal price pattern for a particular commodity and will vary between countries. For example, it might be considered normal for prices to increase at 10-20 per cent per month in the middle of the marketing season, however, price rises of 40-50 per cent per month over a period of two months would be considered abnormal and this could signify market shortages necessitating action by the reserve agency. Releases should be made progressively so that their impact on prices can be monitored. It should be noted that the objective is to bring the rate of price rise to normal levels rather than to try to push prices down. Once this state has been reached further releases should be stopped. Care also needs to be taken to ensure that releases do not undermine the import positions of the private sector by pushing
prices below the import parity price threshold. This is essential, irrespective of the rate of price increase, if the private sector is to have confidence to undertake grain imports. It should be remembered that if the private sector is discouraged from importing grain government will have to assume responsibility including the financial cost.
- when the market price reaches the ceiling price under a price stabilisation policy. Again, if the ceiling price is below import parity, private sector imports will be discouraged.
Authority for deciding to release grain for sale in the market should be vested in the governing body of the agency responsible for the reserve, e.g. Food Security Committee in the case of the parastatal or commercial organisation and the Board of Directors or Trustees for an institutional reserve agency. The decision should be made in accordance with the laid down procedures and once made should be put into effect by the respective management teams.
Options for releasing grain from the reserve into the market include:
- direct sale by the agency from the storage location at either a fixed or prevailing market price. Prices should not necessarily be the same in different locations, but rather reflect the normal price differential between locations. Under this system the agency would offer to sell to all-comers at a stated price quantities of grain, up to the sanctioned limit. This should be released as a fixed daily, or weekly, amount for a set period. To avoid a multitude of small sales a minimum lot size could be applied, say 10 tonnes, i.e. equivalent to a lorry load;
- sale by open public tender. Following an open invitation to bid for quantities of grain through open public tender, contracts would be awarded to successful bidders on the basis of the highest bids and any reserve price the agency may wish to apply. This would help avoid grain being sold at prices significantly below the prevailing market price. Typically such a reserve price would be equivalent to the prevailing import parity price. This process offers the opportunity for traders to compete for the grain on offer in accordance with their perception of market conditions and without undermining the positions of those traders who have made arrangements to import grain. To provide opportunities for both large scale, e.g. modern mills, and small-scale market operators, e.g. local traders and hammermill operators, to bid, consideration could be given adopting a two tier system in which lots of say 500 tonnes would be offered for large-scale operators and 10 tonnes for
small-scale operators.
- sale through a commodity exchange, Appendix 4. While in practice it is similar to sale by open public tender it is somewhat easier to organise provided that there is an effective functioning commodity exchange. Again different lot sizes can be offered to cater for differing needs.
- if the reserve is managed and operated by a parastatal or commercial organisation, consideration could be given to releasing the grain from the reserve through their commercial marketing network.
Whichever method, or combination of methods, is chosen for the release of grain the authorisations required and the procedures to be followed should be clearly specified in the Operational Procedures Manual.

Week No. 3
January 1997
FACTS ON MEALIE MEAL PRICES
Prices for all varieties of mealie meal have, overall, remained stable over the past week, while average mealie meal prices of this month show a slight increase compared with those of December last year. For breakfast meal, prices for a 25kg bag range from K.8,500 in Kabwe to K11,625 in Kasama. In Lusaka and Ndola, prevailing average breakfast meal prices are K10,000 and K.9,100 resp. The average price of this month compared to that of December 1996, shows an increase within the range of 2 -5 %, with fee exception of Lusaka, where an increase of 14% is recorded, and Solwezi and Mansa, where prices slightly declined. Prices for roller meal this week range from K6,500 in Kabwe to K9,200 in Kasama. In Lusaka and Ndola, prevailing roller meal prices are K7,500 and K7.800 resp. The average price of this month compared to that of last month, shows an increase within the range of 3 - 9%, with the exception of Chipata where prices remain stable. For 'hammer meal', estimated prices
per 25kg, inclusive of a service charge for milling., range from K4,100 in Choma to K6,650 in Ndola. The average price of this month compared to that of last month, shows a general decrease, with the exception of Ndola, Chipata and Choma, where increases of resp. 3.7%, 4.2% and 11% are recorded. In general, the above prices for mealie meal rather move below the levels expected for this time of the year. First, current real prices of breakfast and roller meal are, in absolute terms, still significantly below those of January '96, '95 and '94. Second, nominal and real prices are still far below levels that can be expected on the basis of average seasonal price variations.
RUMOURS ON MEALIE MEAL PRICES
The sudden attention the issue of mealie meal prices gets in the press, claiming that these prices are far too high, is very unfortunate since it cannot be substantiated in any way on the basis of data received through the Agricultural Market Information System, further analysis of existing price series, or information received from other reliable sources like, for instance, the ACE. The source that seems to have been responsible for the rumour of hiked mealie meal prices and the attention the subject has since gained in the daily press, has been an item in one of last week's news items of ZNBC. The news item mentioned that prices of breakfast meal had increased with K3.000 to some K12.000 per 25kg bag at some places in Lusaka. Apart from not giving a realistic picture by quoting the average recorded price of breakfast meal in Lusaka, the traditional use of the price of breakfast meal as a general reference for the level of food prices doesn't seem to be appropriate when
some 70-80% of the population relies on other varieties of mealie, i.e. 'hammer' and roller meal.
It is unfortunate that the press reports have appeared at a time that the whole maize market is, if anything, moving very smoothly. In general, this is to the benefit of all market participants, i.e. traders, farmers and consumers. It can only be hoped that the same reports will not prove to become 'self-fulfilling' as that might unnecessary disturb the market, prove to be detrimental to the market participants at large and, worse, ultimately lead to a loss of confidence among the traders and farmers in the operation of the market.

Appendix 2 - Using risk management in grain trade: Implications for developing countries
(Extract from Using Risk Management in Grain Trade: Implications for Developing Countries^1)
^1 Using Risk Management in Grain Trade: Implications For Developing Countries, Prepared by UNCTAD for Intergovernmental Group on Grains meeting organised by FAO June 1995.
Introduction and Background
.....During the last few years, there has been a growing trend towards liberalisation of commodity markets, both domestically and globally. The impetus for such changes stemmed from structural adjustment programmes and government commitments to more open trade polices in the context of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations. Many governments of developed and developing countries have abolished structures and institutional arrangements that regulated commodity marketing and market prices in the past. Especially in the developing countries, often drastic measures have been taken to give a larger role to the private sector.
However, reducing government intervention in commodity markets has also left important vacuums. One of these relates to the role formerly played by the state in setting producer and consumer prices for food commodities, enhancing the image and reliability of export regimes and providing counterparty guarantees to oversees importers. The second relates to a considerable shift of exposure to the risk of world market price instability from the state to farmers, private traders and processors. By and large, the degree of their exposure to price risks and their capacity to manage such risks have not been taken into account fully in the new liberalised environment.
For an important share of internationally traded agricultural commodities, risks can in principle be laid off on the market, by using risk management instruments. Two broad types of market-based commodity price risk management instruments are standardised or tailor-made contracts. The former (commodity futures and options) stipulate the price to be paid for a specified volume of the commodity, its precise quality and delivery period. The latter are over-the-counter contracts (forward contracts, swaps and commodity bonds and loans) offered by commodity trading houses and financial institutions and are tailor-made to the needs of the client.....
Standardised Contracts
Well functioning futures and options exchanges provide the most efficient and equitable price discovery mechanism available and facilitate physical trade. Their creation is an alternative for countries which are moving away from internal price and marketing controls. Domestic futures markets can also serve as "collection points" for local risk management needs, accessible to those unable to use foreign markets, while larger market participants can transfer the risks abroad. The futures markets in developed countries are strictly supervised by governments, and the performance of contract obligations is guaranteed by highly-capitalised, clearing houses. These markets can be accessed directly through brokerage firms, the larger of which have offices in some developing countries, and indirectly through trading houses.
Futures Contracts
A futures contract is an agreements to purchase or sell a commodity an o specified future date at a pre-set price. Futures are used to hedge against price risks by locking-in a future price, while avoiding the credit risk involved in forward contracts. There is and initial cash transfer for margin payments and daily cash transfers may be required. An initial position can easily and quickly be closed or reversed. Physical delivery of the commodity is not necessarily implied. The maturity is mostly up to 18 months and sometimes 36 months.
The commodities contracts offered by the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and other futures exchanges are standardised: they specify a standard quality, quantity, time and location of delivery. Taking delivery on these standard contracts is rarely useful for developing country importers. Rather, while continuing to buy grain from regular suppliers, the use of the futures market allows importers to price the contracts more or less independently because import prices will not be at the same level as the Chicago prices. The difference is called the "basis", or the difference between the import price of a country and the reference price on the futures market (which normally reflects transport costs, competitive pressure and eventually also currency values). However, the "basis risk" importers run when hedging is generally much smaller than the absolute price risk without hedging. Hedging on the basis is also a highly valuable tool for importers eager to lower their purchasing
prices; they can be used, for example, to reduce the impact of temporary localised bottlenecks in transport, port discharging facilities, etc.
The following example illustrates the use of futures contracts to reduce the price risk as well as the basis:
A grain importing agency knows that, in three months time, it will have to import 27,200 tonnes of wheat (200 standard contracts of 5,000 bushels or 136 tonnes). The price quoted in Chicago for delivery in three months is US$ 116/tonne. The importer finds this an attractive price (a price which, even taking into account the normal price differential between Chicago and the country's ports, allows it to stay within its budget), and approaches a number of traders for offers of forward contracts, with delivery in three months time. The lowest delivered price offered is US$ 135/tonne. However, the importing agency considers the basis of US$ 19/tonne (US$ 135 - US$ 116) too large. Nevertheless, since it does not want to risk that prices increase before it can sign a more attractive contract, it decides to hedge the major portion of the price risk by buying 200 contracts on the CBOT. One month later prices have increased to US$ 130/per tonne, but for delivery to the country,
traders now quote a basis of only US$ 15/tonne over the Chicago contract, that is,
US$ 145/tonne. The importer decides to close out its futures position (by selling 200 futures contracts), and to enter into a forward contract for delivery in two months. The effective price is somewhat over US$ 131/tonne, that is the contract price of US$ 145/tonne minus the US$ 14/tonne profit on the futures transactions (US$ 130 - US$ 116), plus commission costs which are to be paid to an intermediating futures market broker.
While this type of hedge transaction allows an importer to lock in an attractive price and to negotiate a better "basis", it has two major disadvantages. First, there is the risk that prices will decline, making the importer vulnerable to criticism for having locked in a price which, in hindsight, is no longer attractive. In the example above, if Chicago prices had declined to US$ 100/tonne (and the basis to US$ 15/tonne), the importer would still have effectively paid around US$ 13 I/per tonne, because of a USS 16/tonne loss on the futures market. Second, the importer has to pay a deposit as "security" for his position, and if prices move adversely, the trader faces additional "margin calls". The margins involved can be considerable; in the example above, if the Chicago wheat price declined by US$ 5/tonne, the importer would have to pay an additional US$ 136,000, within 24 hours.
Options
The use of options can provide a partial solution to the above problems. An option is the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell a commodity on or before a specified date at a pre-set price. Options are used to limit the size of losses from unfavourable movements in commodity prices in the future but also allow the opportunity to take advantage of favourable price movements. Put options (option to sell) provide protection against price declines, call options (option to buy) provide protection against price increases. There is an initial cash transfer, the premium, or the cost of the option, from the buyer to the seller of an option. Sellers (but not buyers) of exchange-traded options are exposed to margin requirements. Options are largely executed on a futures contract for the commodity rather than the physical commodity itself. The maturity of exchange-traded options contracts is mostly up to one year.
Options can best be compared with insurance: they protect against unfavourable price movements, and, if no adverse developments take place, one is free to profit from whatever the market offers. As insurance, the premium is lost if the option expires unused. The easy availability of options provides one of the most radical innovations in grain trading in the last decade, even though, in practice, making effective use of options may not be easy.
The following example of the use of options to limit an importer's exposure to price increases:
An occasional wheat importer may not wish to pay more than a world market price of US$ 160/tonne. In February 1994, CBOT prices were US$ 150/tonne and an option for the right to buy at US$ 155/tonne during the period of 6 months had a premium of US$ 3/tonne. By buying 200 contracts at a total cost of US$ 81,000 (27,200 tonnes times US$ 3), the importing agency effectively protected its import price at US$ 158/tonne, plus the basis. Six months later, however, market prices had declined to US$ 140/tonne, and the options expired worthless with a loss of US$ 81,000. The importer would have been compensated by lower grain prices if it had wished to import, but as it still had no imminent import needs, the importing agency decided to re-establish an options position for 200 contracts which gives the right to buy at US$ 145/tonne, again at a premium of US$ 3/tonne. In October, there is a need for imports, and the importer buys 30,000 tonnes on the market, at the world market
price plus the country's normal margin of CIF delivery. The world market price in October is US$ 168/tonne, but the options that the importer holds have a value of around US$ 23/tonne, giving a net profit on the options of US$ 17/tonne (US$ 23 minus US$ 6/tonne for the two premium charges). For that part of its import needs for which the importing agency had established a price protection, it pays a net price of only US$ 151/tonne (saving around US$ 462,000, or 10 percent of the import bill). It is worthwhile to note that if futures contracts had been used, the effective import price would have been US$ 150/tonne (the CBOT market price for February), but this strategy would have put a larger pressure on cash flows; requiring a deposit of US$ 200,000 as initial guarantee, and by June, an additional US$ 150,000 for margin calls....

Appendix 4 - Modalities for the sale of designated commodities by the food reserve agency (FRA)
(Extract from pamphlet prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, Food Security Division, Lusaka Zambia)
General
In accordance with the Food Reserve Act No. 12, Section 8, Sub-section 2 and as published in the Government Gazette, Notice No. 28 of 12th January 1996, the Food Security Division, acting on behalf of the Food Reserve Agency, hereby notifies the public that approximately 40,000 metric tonnes of white/yellow maize will be released for sale from the national Strategic Reserve between February and April, 1996. The release of the maize will be through the Agricultural Commodity Exchange. (ACE).
As earlier advertised, the releases are mainly made for purposes of stock recycling prior to the end of the current marketing season so as to enable the FRA to replenish stocks from domestically produced maize during the 1996/97 marketing season. Releases will be undertaken during the months of February through April at a rate of about 13,000 tonnes per month.
Basic Principles
As the quantities of maize sold are relatively small as compared to the monthly commercial consumption requirements, no disincentives for or disruptions of normal commercial market operations are anticipated. The sales modalities have been design to ensure that:
- prices reflect actual market prices
- prices allow for a full recovery of the costs incurred by the FRA in buying, handling and storing the reserve stocks;
- access to reserve stocks is guaranteed for all market participants, notably the small-scale trading and milling sector; and
- sales and financial transactions are handled in a transparent and accountable manner.
Procedures
The following procedures will be used for the sale of the reserve stocks: w
- maize will be offered for sale through the ACE every week on a fixed day of the week, i.e. every Wednesday, and in fixed, i.e. standing, lot sizes. Lot sizes vary by location as presented in the table below.
- all maize will be offered for sale at a strict reserve price.
- bids have to be made per lot by location as indicated in the table below. Bidders may bid for more than one lot at one or more locations.
- bids will be received on a Free-on-Truck basis, i.e. ex-warehouse/depot. Bids for the weekly sale on Wednesday will be received from Monday 08.00 a.m. by fax or telephone (written confirmation also required), or in writing, and bidding will close on Tuesday at 13.00 hrs.
- individual lots will be allocated to the highest bidders at or above the reserve price. Allocations will be made public by 14.30 hrs. on Wednesday at the premises of the ACE and successful bidders will be informed immediately.
- payment, on a strictly cash or bank certified cheque basis only, will be required prior to Friday close of business. Deferred payment on credit will not be allowed. Allocated bids for which no payment has been received will be cancelled. The ACE reserves the right to re-allocate such lots to the next
- upon confirmation that payment has been received, a "Maize Release Note" (MEN) will be issued to the buyer for presentation to the storage agent(s).
- the buyer may collect maize from the warehouse on presentation on the MRN. It will be the buyer's responsibility to ensure that the quantity and quality of the maize is in accordance with the stipulated conditions. No further liabilities on account of quality and/or quantity will be recognised by the FRA, ACE, or the storage agents, once the maize has left the store.
- any amount of the quota reserved for a specific day which remains unallocated will be carried over to the next offer day and added on to the specified lot sizes offered for sale on that day.
- any amount of stocks remaining unsold after the proposed sales period will be carried-over as reserve stocks during 1996/97.
Sales Calendar
Maize will be offered for sale over a 10 week period, i.e. starting from 19th February, 1996, through 26th April 1996, at the latest. Given the envisaged 14 week sales period, an average of some 3,850 metric tonnes will be offered for sale on a weekly basis comprising 3,150 mt of white and 700 mt of yellow maize, respectively. The following quantities will be offered on each of these days:
