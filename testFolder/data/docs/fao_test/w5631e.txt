STATEMENT BY THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL^3
6. The Director-General delivered his statement to the Council. The full text of this statement is given in Appendix D to this Report.
WORLD FOOD AND AGRICULTURE SITUATION
CURRENT WORLD FOOD AND AGRICULTURE SITUATION^4
7. The Council assessed the current world food situation on the basis of the documents presented. A number of Member Nations reported on their own agricultural situation and outlook and on progress toward implementation of the World Food Summit Plan of Action. The Council expressed general satisfaction with global agricultural production performance in 1996, and particularly the noteworthy expansion in Africa. Concern, however, was expressed over persistent and emergency food shortages in many countries and the slowdown in production growth rate in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. The Council appreciated the Secretariat documents while at the same time it noted some alternative projections and interpretations of the near-term outlook. The Council suggested that in future reporting, the Secretariat should take a more future-oriented view, increase its monitoring of prices, stocks, stock to consumption ratio, export earnings and the broad food security situation.
8. Concern was expressed over the decline in food aid, while at the same time it was recognised that food aid was not a long-term answer to sustainable food security.
9. The Council recognised the importance of the reform process underway in world agricultural trade policy. It noted the need for improved access for the exports of all countries, especially the developing countries as a way to increase countries' capacity to import their food needs. The need for improved price transmission to producers was also recognized. Many members stressed that despite the fall in international cereal prices during the past year, food import bills were still a major drain on their balance-of-payments. The Council noted that various steps were planned or underway following the Marrakech Agreement on Measures Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least Developed and Net Food-Importing Developing Countries.
10. The Council noted that a continuing problem for the food security of many developing countries was the fluctuations of food production associated with climate variability, which also led to variation in the required volume of food imports. Access to sufficient food was also a continuing problem for food security. The Council recognised that food production fluctuations in developing countries could be reduced by better control of water, especially through appropriate use of irrigation, reducing post harvest losses, strengthening research and extension, and improving agricultural infrastructure.
11. The Council recognised that food production would need to be boosted in many developing countries to support a reasonable degree of self-reliance. Many members welcomed the fact that several key indicators of food security monitored by FAO were moving in a positive direction. While welcoming the rise in cereal stocks in 1996-97, many members noted that the global stock-to-consumption ratio was below the 17-18 percent minimum safe level as estimated by the FAO Secretariat. Other members felt that there was not a close correlation between global food security and this particular indicator.
FOLLOW-UP TO THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT^5
12. The Council endorsed the report of the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) on all aspects of the World Food Summit and the follow-up to the Declaration and Plan of Action, prepared in compliance with Conference Resolution 2/95, and decided to transmit this report to the Twenty-ninth Session of the Conference, with its own views as reflected below.
13. Conscious that this was its first session following the Summit, which had constituted a milestone in the life of the Organization, the Council reaffirmed its satisfaction that the Summit had met the objectives of sensitizing public opinion to the importance of achieving food security for all, of providing a framework for concerted action to achieve it, and of moving food security higher on the national and international political agenda.
14. The Council stressed the crucial importance of maintaining the momentum generated by the Summit, and reaffirmed the catalytic role of FAO, in supporting this follow-up process in cooperation with all organizations in the UN system, as well as other competent international institutions. The primary responsibility of national governments for ensuring sustained implementation of the Plan of Action was stressed, as was the importance of international support to their efforts. In this connection, regret was expressed by numerous Member Nations that resources for official development assistance and food aid, as well as for international agencies such as FAO, continued to decline.
15. The Council noted with satisfaction steps taken by a number of countries to prepare national plans of action as a follow-up to the Summit, engaging in the process all stakeholders. It also took note of FAO's initiative to encourage preparation of national agricultural development strategies for developing countries and countries in transition and of country food security briefs for developed countries. Stress was placed on the importance of ensuring that the process was demand-driven, and undertaken only with the full participation and agreement of the concerned governments.
16. The Council endorsed the monitoring and reporting process proposed by the Committee on World Food Security.
17. The Council noted with satisfaction the progress already made in launching the Food Insecurity and Vulnerability Information and Mapping System (FIVIMS) in collaboration with concerned UN system organizations, competent national institutions and non-governmental organizations. It stressed the need for the process to be country-driven and for governments and their respective societies and stakeholders to be closely involved in its development. The Council approved the proposed workplan for the gradual development and establishment of FIVIMS at national and international levels, building upon existing information systems and mechanisms. It noted the need of developing countries for technical assistance to improve the quality and interpretation of statistical data related to FIVIMS.
18. Consistent with the integrated follow-up mechanisms for UN Conferences adopted by ECOSOC, the Council welcomed the arrangements endorsed by the Administrative Committee on Coordination (ACC), for inter-agency follow-up to the Summit. It was noted that the mechanism established would operate, at the country level, within the framework of the UN Resident Coordinator system, with support provided, at the global level, through the ACC network operated jointly by FAO and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), with the close involvement of the World Food Programme (WFP) and other concerned organizations. The Council also noted with appreciation the cooperation established with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Human Rights Centre to promote work related to the right to food consistent with the mandate of the Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Committee in full accord with Objective 7.4 of the Plan of Action.
19. The Council noted FAO's initiative of launching Telefood in conjunction with World Food Day 1997 to keep the decisions taken at the Summit in the public eye, and to collect additional funds aimed at contributing to the alleviation of hunger in the world. Some members indicated their desire to receive detailed information following the event on costs and use of the funds generated in order to determine whether similar activities should be considered in the future. Other members were concerned by the fund-raising aspects of this event and were worried the effect should not be to reduce contributions to other appeals. The Council was informed that all funds collected would be used to foster food security and would be subject to audit by reputable international firms.
20. The Council re-confirmed its support for the objectives of the Special Programme for Food Security (SPFS), and welcomed South-South and extra-budgetary support to the SPFS from members, multilateral institutions, international and regional financial institutions. Members from participating countries reported on their positive experiences and results achieved so far, which they considered were fully in accord with the WFS commitments. Certain members encouraged an expansion of the SPFS coverage to include all the Low-Income Food-Deficit Countries (LIFDCs), while other members considered that the SPFS should be made available to all developing countries where there were pockets of food insecurity. Other members questioned the approach of the Special Programme. The identification of the resources involved in the SPFS was also requested. The essential role of national and international research organizations and institutes was stressed, as was the necessity for evaluation of
the pilot phase results and constraints before moving to the expansion phase of the SPFS. Some members requested and received further clarification on the relationship between the Technical Cooperation Programme (TCP) and the SPFS. Many members requested the strengthening of the TCP as an indispensible tool for international cooperation within FAO, stressing that this programme should maintain its independence.
REPORTS OF THE TWENTY-SECOND (Rome, 23-30 September 1996, 8-9 and 28-31 October 1996) AND TWENTY-THIRD (Rome, 14-18 April 1997) SESSIONS OF THE COMMITTEE ON WORLD FOOD SECURITY^6
21. The Council considered and adopted the Reports of the Twenty-second and Twenty-third Sessions of the Committee on World Food Security, noting that the Committee had worked diligently and well to prepare the World Food Summit and to lay the foundations for monitoring implementation of its undertakings.
REPORTS OF THE THIRD EXTRAORDINARY SESSION (Rome 9-13 December 1996) AND THE SEVENTH REGULAR (Rome, 15-23 May 1997) SESSIONS OF THE COMMISSION ON GENETIC RESOURCES FOR FOOD AND AGRICULTURE^7
22. The Council considered and adopted the reports of the Third Extraordinary and Seventh Regular Sessions of the Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. The Council noted the process of the broadening of the mandate of the Commission to all genetic resources of interest to food and agriculture.
23. The Council welcomed the decision of the Commission to establish geographically-balanced, inter-governmental technical working groups on farm animal and plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, to carry out specific tasks assigned by the Commission.
24. The Council emphasized, in particular, the importance of developing the Global Strategy for the Management of Farm Animal Genetic Resources and supporting national efforts to implement the Global Plan of Action on Plant Genetic Resources. It reiterated the priorities set by the Seventh Session of the Commission: the convening, as a first priority, of an Extraordinary Session of the Commission devoted solely to the continuing negotiations for the revision of the International Undertaking; as a second priority, of the Inter-governmental Technical Working Group on Farm Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture; and as the third priority, of the Inter-governmental Technical Working Group on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. It noted that the Organization's ability to meet these priorities would depend upon the budget allocations under the current and the 1998-99 Programme of Work and Budget and urged the Director-General to allocate the necessary
funds in the budget and, if necessary, seek extra-budgetary resources to ensure the holding of the meetings agreed by the Commission.
25. The Council called for the timely conclusion of the negotiation of the revision of the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, keeping in mind the recommendations of the Leipzig Conference. The Council agreed on the urgent need to convene the proposed Extraordinary Session of the Commission, but no agreement was reached on whether this session should be held before or after the Fourth Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity.
26. The Council welcomed the contributions that had been made by Switzerland, Sweden and Norway to support the participation of developing countries in the negotiations and to support regional meetings, and invited donor countries to provide further funds to ensure developing country participation in future negotiations.
ACTIVITIES OF FAO AND WFP
REPORT OF THE SIXTY-FIRST SESSION OF THE COMMITTEE ON COMMODITY PROBLEMS ^8
(Rome, 25-28 February 1997)
27. The Council considered and adopted the Report of the Sixty-first Session of the Committee on Commodity Problems (CL 112/6). It was informed that, at the request of the CCP at its Sixty-first Session, the Consultative Sub-Committee on Surplus Disposal (CSSD) had agreed on its revised Report.
28. The Council took note of the confirmation given by the delegate of Thailand of his Government's offer to hold the First Session of the Sub-group on Tropical Fruits, in Pattaya, 21-24 April 1998. It also took note of the planned meeting of the Intergovernmental Group on Tea to be hosted by Indonesia, 2-4 July, 1997 in Bali. The Council was informed that this meeting would be held back-to-back with a meeting of the International Business Conference, sponsored by the Indonesian Tea Association and the Ministry of Agriculture.
REPORT OF THE TWENTY-SECOND SESSION OF THE COMMITTEE ON FISHERIES ^9
(Rome, 17-20 March 1997)
29. The Council considered and adopted the Report of the Twenty-second Session of the Committee on Fisheries. In particular, the Council:
a) reconfirmed the importance of the implementation of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries if fish stocks were to be managed in a sustainable manner and reiterated the need for guidelines to be established on the relevant articles of the Code;
b) reaffirmed the need to increase the contribution of aquaculture to employment and income of rural populations and thus to food security, and called for priority to be given to the sustainable development of environmentally-sound aquaculture;
c) stressed the need for effective regional fishery organizations and arrangements and agreed that FAO regional fishery bodies should be reviewed and evaluated by their respective members on a case by case basis, with a view to strengthening each body as appropriate.
d) stressed that excessive fishing capacity and fishing effort leading to overfishing continue to require special attention by FAO and Member Nations.
REPORT OF THE THIRTEENTH SESSION OF THE COMMITTEE ON FORESTRY (Rome, 10-13 March 1997)^10
30. The Council considered and adopted the Report of the Thirteenth Session of the Committee on Forestry. In particular the Council:
a) supported FAO's activities in the promotion of sustainable forest management, especially in the follow-up to UNCED as Task Manager for the Implementation of Agenda 21 and in support of the Inter-governmental Panel on Forests (IPF);
b) agreed that in view of the post-UNCED importance of Forestry, FAO should allocate additional resources to the Forestry Programme;
c) supported the recommendation of COFO for the further prioritization of FAO's activities in forestry;
31. The Council took note of the statement by the Turkish delegation regarding progress in preparations for the Eleventh World Forestry Congress, to be held in Antalya (Turkey) from 13 to 22 October 1997.
REPORT OF THE FOURTEENTH SESSION OF THE COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE (Rome, 7-11 April 1997) ^11
32. The Council considered and adopted the Report of the Fourteenth Session of the Committee on Agriculture (COAG). In particular, the Council stressed the conclusions and recommendations relating to plant and animal genetic resources, the role of livestock in rural development and food security, agricultural research, global information and early warning, women in agricultural and rural development and follow-up to the Uruguay Round agreements, including Codex and IPPC standards. In line with COAG's recommendations, it decided to transmit the two draft phytosanitary standards - "Guidelines for Surveillance" and "Export Certification System" - to the Twenty-ninth Session of the Conference for adoption as International Phytosanitary Standards.
Revision of the IPPC
33. The Council established an Informal Open-ended Working Group to consider the remaining bracketed text of the revised International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) which had been submitted to Council by COAG. The Chairman of the Working Group, in his report to Council, listed the agreed amendments and stated that the resulting text remained without brackets.
34. The Council was informed of a proposal for an additional article, provisionally Article II bis, to specify the relation of the revised IPPC to other relevant international agreements. It agreed to the inclusion of this article without brackets and decided that it would be submitted to the Committee on Constitutional and Legal Matters (CCLM) at its Sixty-eighth Session, to consider its legal implications and to determine its precise wording and place within the Convention.
35. The Council attached great importance to the provision on the reporting of the occurrence, outbreak or spread of pests. It understood that the reports would have to be supplied - as under the current IPPC - to the Secretary of the IPPC. It underlined the importance of establishing relevant procedures applicable to this reporting and urged that high priority be given to this work.
36. The Council endorsed the revised text of the IPPC and unanimously recommended that it be transmitted through the CCLM and the Hundred and Thirteenth Session of the Council to the Twenty-ninth Session of the Conference for adoption.
37. In welcoming the revised text of the IPPC as an important step in facilitating and safeguarding international trade in food and agricultural products, the Council noted that the specific need for developing country contracting parties, in particular the least developed countries, should be provided with technical assistance. Such assistance was required in order to enhance their capacity to fulfil their obligations under the Convention and to facilitate its implementation.
38. The Council also recommended that the Conference, in adopting the revised IPPC, consider the necessity for appropriate interim measures for the period between the adoption of the IPPC and its entry into force, including the establishment of an interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures.
WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME
First Annual Report of the WFP Executive Board^12
39. The Council expressed appreciation for the new format and the very concise content of the annual report which described, in a comprehensive manner, the activities of the Executive Board and reflected the considerable achievements of WFP in 1996. It welcomed the importance given to the follow-up to the World Food Summit, stressed the importance of WFP for development activities and recognised the usefulness of the synergetic collaboration between WFP and FAO.
40. The Council approved the Executive Board's Report.
41. The Council, after considering document CL 112/13-Sup.1 "WFP Pledging Target", adopted the following resolution:
Resolution 1/112
Target for WFP pledges for the period 1999-2000
THE COUNCIL,
Noting
the endorsement by the Executive Board of the World Food Programme of a target of one billion United States dollars (2,1 million tonnes) for voluntary contributions to the Programme for the period 1999-2000,
Recalling
Resolutions 2462 (XXIII) and 2682 (XXV) of the General Assembly, which recognised the experience gained by WFP in the field of multilateral food aid,
1. Submits for consideration and approval of the Conference of the FAO the above pledging target;
2. Urges Members of the United Nations and Members and Associate Members of the Food and Agriculture Organization to undertake the necessary preparation for the announcement of pledges at the forthcoming Pledging Conference of the World Food Programme.
Rome, 7 June 1997
Revision of the General Regulations of the World Food Programme^13
42. The Council congratulated the Open-ended Working Group of the Executive Board of WFP, the Legal Counsel of FAO/WFP and the WFP Secretariat for their valuable contribution to the work and, in particular, for the very positive climate of the debate within the Working Group and the Board.
43. Some members indicated their intention to seek in future WFP Executive Board sessions an improvement to the draft General Rules that would ensure the timeliness of WFP reports, in particular those related to bilaterally-funded projects.
44. The Council expressed its full support for the revised General Regulations and approved the following draft resolution for transmission to the Conference for its adoption:

48. The Council noted that consultations had taken place among Heads of Delegation represented at the Council session in order to designate the candidates who would be approached to serve as Chairman of the Conference and Chairmen of Commissions I, II and III.
PROGRAMME, BUDGETARY, FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS
PROGRAMME EVALUATION REPORT 1996-97 ^15
49. The Council considered the Programme Evaluation Report 1996-97, and noted with appreciation the several improvements made in the latest report.
50. The Council endorsed the Programme Committee's views on the Programme Evaluation Report 1996-97, especially those on the inclusion of programme managers' comments on the individual programme reviews and the summary assessment on programme performance based on the criteria for programme analysis suggested by the Council at its Hundred and Tenth Session (Rome, 2-3 November 1995). It agreed that these innovations enhanced the transparency of the evaluation process and promoted interaction between evaluators and programme managers. With regard to the criteria, it considered that these could need to be refined to reflect the experience of their application over the last biennium.
51. The Council also endorsed the Programme Committee's recommendations for further improving the analytical content of the Programme Evaluation Report. It highlighted, in particular, the need for more systematic analysis of the effects and impact of FAO programmes, as well as the use of external expertise in programme evaluation while bearing in mind the cost implications of such approaches. It also stressed the importance of improving the quality of programme design, which should contain clear objectives and priorities, implementation strategy and a set of measurable performance targets and indicators. It stressed that the lessons of experience in this area should be built into new project designs. It also noted that the findings of the Programme Evaluation Report should be incorporated into the Medium-Term Plan.
52. The Council further endorsed the recommendations of the Programme and Finance Committees with regard to FAO publications: (a) that the proposed change in publication distribution from the quota distribution system to that based on "national publication accounts" be accepted in principle for further consideration; and (b) that all major FAO publications be issued, in all five official languages, recognizing the need for flexibility in certain cases.
53. On this basis, the Council agreed to transmit the Programme Evaluation Report 1996-97 to the Conference for its approval.
MEDIUM-TERM PLAN 1998-2003 ^16
54. The Council recalled that the submission to each Conference of a rolling Medium-Term Plan covering a six-year period, had been instituted by the FAO Conference through Resolution 10/89. It noted, therefore, that this version was the fourth prepared since then, and that it was a rewrite of the Plan approved in 1995 for the period 1996-2001. The Council observed, in this connection, that due efforts had been made to reflect in particular the outcome of the World Food Summit and the relationship between substantive priorities and the commitments in the Summit Plan of Action.
55. Several members agreed that the Plan included a balanced presentation of priorities, which reflected the varied requirements of the membership and were consistent with the overall goal of sustainable food security. While agreeing that there were positive elements in it, other members felt that this version did not fulfil their expectations, and made clear their perception of gaps and weaknesses. The Council agreed that the Medium-Term Plan should reflect the conclusions and recommendations of the Technical Committees of the Council, in particular the Committees on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.
56. Several members offered ideas and suggestions as regarded improvements to the Plan's contents and structure, including that it take account of past achievements and provide a thorough assessment of trends and challenges confronting FAO. Some members suggested that the Medium-Term Plan include concrete proposals for cost-effective actions to increase programmatic and operational savings by expanding collaboration with other international organizations.
57. The Council agreed that the Plan should be a tool for establishing agreement among the membership on broad policy orientations and priorities. It stressed that the prime purpose of the Plan should be to offer a strategic vision of the future work of FAO, taking into account the universal character of the FAO, the synergy between its normative and its operative activities and based on a careful analysis of the operating environment and the strategic choices open to the Organization, together with an implementation programme to carry the vision into effect.
58. In light of this discussion, the Council recognised the force of the recommendation from the Programme Commmittee that the Governing Bodies should revisit medium-term planning practices in FAO. The Council noted that the Medium-Term Plan should be a key component of FAO's overall planning system, incorporating the lessons learned from the Programme Evaluation Report and the Programme Implementation Report, and providing the framework and guidance within which the biennial Programme of work and Budget was developed.
59. The Council also noted that the new programme framework which was being pilot-tested in the Summary and full Programme of Work and Budget was consistent with the key principles which should apply to a revised approach to the Medium-Term Plan. In particular, the concepts of measurable and time-bound targets and indicators should be central to the new programme planning framework.
60. Accordingly, the Council requested the Secretariat to prepare a paper for the Programme Committee at its September 1997 session which reviewed and discussed the options for an adapted medium-term planning process. The Programme Committee would then put proposals to the Council at its session, immediately before the FAO Conference; and the Council would put a recommendation to the Conference.
61. The Council concluded that consideration of the Medium-Term Plan by the Conference together with the proposals for an adapted planning process would facilitate Conference decisions.
SUMMARY PROGRAMME OF WORK AND BUDGET 1998-99 ^17
General aspects
62. The Council welcomed the integration of "other" income into the Programme of Work, and looked forward to its further elaboration and refinement in the full Programme of Work and Budget.
63. The Council also endorsed the new programming approach being tested in the Summary Programme of Work and Budget (SPWB) under Programme 2.1.1 Natural Resources. It would reexamine the merits in the full Programme of Work and Budget in the light of more comprehensive information, and would further advise the Conference accordingly.
Financial aspects
64. The Council was informed that a revision downwards of about US$ 3 million in the cost increase estimate of US$ 39 million presented in the SPWB was likely in view of the evolution of inflation in the Host Country. The Council also noted the potential favourable impact of the US dollar-Italian Lira exchange rate on the budget level, should present rates continue until the Conference.
65. The Council was informed that the inclusion of after-service medical coverage costs in 1998-99 would incur additional costs in the region of US$ 17 million.
66. The Council noted that the inclusion of US$ 17 million for after-service medical costs would exceed the reductions due to lower inflation and the change in the dollar/lira rate, and therefore would indicate that a zero real growth budget would represent an increase of US$ 42 million above the budget for the current biennium.
Budget discussions
67. The largest group of members stressed the importance of the World Food Summit, and the need for an active role of FAO in assisting countries in the implementation of the Summit Commitments and in performing its other functions. It also recalled the reductions in resources experienced by the Organization in the present biennium and its past and present efforts to maximize efficiencies and streamline its operations. It emphasized that this conjunction of factors implied a strengthened FAO in need of increased resources to fulfil its responsibilities and reap the full potential benefits from the reforms. It felt that a further net reduction of resources would send a wrong signal, following the successful conclusion of the Summit. It, therefore, supported the real growth scenario but, in the search for consensus could accept, as a minimum, the zero-real growth proposals.
68. Other members supported the zero nominal growth options as the most financially-realistic and likely to prevent further growth in arrears. They recalled the policies of fiscal restraint underway in many countries and throughout the UN system. Some also stressed their expectations that similar efforts be made by FAO for further reform of the Organization. They emphasised the need for FAO to continue the search for efficiency and other savings, including through greater administrative streamlining, governance reforms and operational improvements. These, together with an innovative approach to prioritisation of programmes, would enable achievement of zero nominal growth or less while still ensuring that FAO continued to deliver on its core functions, including reduction of food insecurity, and to enhance its reputation as a centre of international excellence. Some of these members felt that the FAORs was an area where further savings could be sought, particularly given the
expanding capabilities of the regional and sub-regional offices. Closer co-operation within the UN Resident Co-ordinator framework should also be utilised. Other members stressed the importance of the FAOR programme to their countries and regions, in complementarity with the Regional and Sub-regional offices. Some members requested that consideration be given to the possibility of establishing a Sub-regional Office for the sub-region of Central America.
69. One member indicated its continued support for a budget level of US$ 610 to US$ 615 million.
70. In the light of the above differing positions, the Council recognised that it was not in a position at the present time to reach a consensus on a budget level for 1998-99, and that further refinement of PWB proposals and inter-governmental dialogue would be required to facilitate the search for a possible consensus at the September sessions of the Programme and Finance Committees and its own next session, prior to final consideration of the Programme of Work and Budget by the Conference. In this connection, the Council stressed the desirability of avoiding the problems experienced in the aftermath of the decision on the budget level at the last Conference in October 1995.
71. The Council recalled the importance of fully reflecting the priorities, recommendations and conclusions which had been expressed by the Committees of the Council in their respective sectors in the preparation of the full Programme of Work and Budget, and noted that action was under way in this respect.
72. The Council also stressed the need to protect to the maximum extent possible the economic, technical and policy activities of the Organization and to maintain an appropriate balance by strengthening synergies between normative and operational activities. It was also essential to continue to ensure full complementarity of action with all FAO partners. It was underlined that FAO should ensure that its activities complement those of other international organizations, and that it take fully into account the ongoing reform process in the UN system. Many members identified specific activities on programmes which they judged to be of highest priority.
73. While noting that the priority-setting criteria endorsed at its Hundred and Tenth Session (Rome, 2-3 November 1995) had been widely applied in the formulation of proposals under all Summary Programme of Work and Budget scenarios, the Council underlined the desirability of further refinement of these criteria to facilitate the assessment of priorities.
Conclusion
74. The Council endorsed the recommendation from the Programme and Finance Committees at their last Joint Session, that for analytical purposes the Secretariat:
a) continue to develop the zero real growth proposal with the base level of US$ 650 million and minimizing cost increases, incorporating all the pertinent factors as regarded the revised estimates for cost increases and the impact of the exchange rate, but seeking maximum cost absorption;
b) continue the search for further efficiency and other savings; and
c) within this overall approach, develop clear options for a zero nominal growth budget, based upon sound prioritization among FAO activities, and also identify activities that would be eliminated if the budget were to be below the zero nominal growth level.
REPORTS OF THE SEVENTY-SIXTH AND SEVENTY-SEVENTH SESSIONS OF THE PROGRAMME COMMITTEE ^18
75. The Council noted these Reports. In addition to items specifically on its own agenda, it noted that the Programme Committee had considered a number of JIU reports.
REPORTS OF THE EIGHTY-SIXTH (Rome, 28-29 January 1997) AND EIGHTY-SEVENTH (Rome, 21-29 April 1997) SESSIONS OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE ^19
76. The Council reviewed the report of the Eighty-sixth and Eighty-seventh Sessions of the Finance Committee, and the latest financial position of the Organization at 30 May 1997.
Status of Contributions ^20
77. In particular, the Council:
(a) noted that the percentage of current assessments received had improved compared with the previous four years.
(b) expressed concern over the high level of arrears outstanding and while appreciating the often difficult financial situation of some countries, underlined the responsibility of all members to honour their financial commitments towards the Organization in full as soon as possible.
Budgetary Performance 1996 ^21
78. The Council noted the comments of the Finance Committee and endorsed the Annual Report of Budgetary Performance to members for the year 1996.
Scale of Contributions 1998-99 ^22
79. The Council:
(a) agreed that it was too early to prejudge the outcome of the discussions being held in the UN Committee on Contributions in New York. It therefore requested the Secretariat to follow the evolution of the matter in New York, and report to the Finance Committee at its September Session and to the Hundred and Thirteenth Session of the Council with an updated situation.
(b) deferred its recommendation of a Draft Resolution on Scale of Contributions 1998-99 until it reviewed the matter again at its Hundred and Thirteenth Session.
Other Matters Arising out of the Reports ^23
80. The Council:
(a) noted that with regard to the Incentive Scheme to Encourage Prompt Payment of Contributions, some members considered that the results of the Scheme demonstrated that it had not produced the desired effects whilst its cost in terms of reduced Miscellaneous Income had been considerable and were, therefore, in favour of its discontinuation. However, many members were in disagreement since they felt that a distinction had to be made between early and late payers. There had been a large increase in the number of Member Nations having paid their contributions before 31 March.
(b) requested that the Finance Committee once again review the issue, as there was no general consensus in supporting the Director-General's recommendation about the continuation or not of the Scheme.
(c) noted the results of the actuarial study on the cost of After Service Medical Coverage and agreed on the need to correctly account for such costs. While it recognised that full service costs for current employees should be included in the budget, it also recognised that certain questions remained outstanding, in particular, as regarded the responsibility for that part of the accumulated liability that related to staff funded by other institutions. The Council requested the Director-General to continue to explore solutions to covering the accumulated liability so as to minimize the negative effects on the substantive output of the Organization, taking into account other approaches being adopted in the UN system. The Council, therefore, concluded that the Finance Committee should again consider the matter at its September session where it should address the proposals of the Director-General in the context of the full Programme of Work and Budget 1998-99.
(d) shared the concern expressed by the Finance Committee in connection with the need to transfer resources from the technical programmes to general policy and direction, support and common services and urged that action be continued to reverse this trend to the extent possible.
REVIEW OF FAO STATUTORY BODIES AND PANELS OF EXPERTS ^24
81. The Council appreciated the information provided in CL 112/20, Review of FAO Statutory Bodies and Panels of Experts, and the conclusions of the Joint Session of the Programme and Finance Committees with respect to Savings and Efficiencies in Governance ^25. The Council was informed of the considerable reduction that had taken place in the duration and costs of the Sessions of the Conference, Council and Council Committees^26 . The Council noted that a preliminary analysis of Statutory Bodies was now underway in line with the directions given by the Council.
82. With some clarifications and amplifications, the Council broadly endorsed both the conclusions of the Programme and Finance Committees and the suggestions in paragraph 26 of CL 112/20. In doing so, the Council reiterated that the search for increased efficiency and effectiveness in governance and the consultative processes between Member Nations was a continuing process. At the same time, Committees, Commissions and Panels of Experts were an important means through which FAO achieved its objectives. In recognizing the efforts made by Member Nations and the Secretariat to increase efficiency savings through the streamlining of agenda items, reductions in documentation and shortening of sessions, the Council reiterated that the search for further savings should not detract from the contributions of Technical Committees, and in particular the effectiveness of governance and the role of the Council and Conference as unique inter-governmental policy fora.
83. The Council considered that there could be scope for a more clear-cut division of work between the Technical Committees of the Council, the Programme and Finance Committees and the Council itself. The Council welcomed the recommendations that Technical Committee sessions should be held earlier in Conference years, and that the January Joint Session of the Programme and Finance Committees in Conference years be eliminated. While most members emphasised that prolonged discussion of PWB proposals in the Technical Committees of the Council detracted from their role as policy and technical fora for their respective sectors, many stressed their unique capacity to comment in-depth on the subject matter of the PWB proposals. The Council agreed that further consultation among Member Nations was required, with advice from the Programme and Finance Committees, on how further streamlining could be achieved.
84. For Regional Conferences and other regional bodies, the Council agreed that it was important to obtain agreement of the countries of the region before changes were made. Regarding the frequency of Regional Conference sessions, many members expressed their desire to convene them biennially, while others suggested a reduced frequency.
85. The Council welcomed the decision of the Programme and Finance Committees to set up a Contact Group to review in detail the recommendations provided in Annex II of CL 112/14 on Commissions and Committees and Expert Committees and Panels. Those Bodies which had not met for a long time could be immediately eliminated, but the views of the main parent committees should generally be sought on the future of their Subsidiary Bodies. The Council agreed that the Codex Alimentarius Commission should review all proposals pertaining to its Bodies. In preparing its recommendations, the Contact Group should take into account the views and detailed points made in the Council discussion and consult closely with concerned Member Nations. In general, Bodies should not be regarded as permanent and more flexible working arrangements and a task-orientated, time-bound framework, including sunset clauses in the Terms of Reference of new Bodies, were desirable. Greater civil society
involvement was generally welcomed, depending on the nature of the various Bodies and with due regard to budgetary constraints.
CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL MATTERS
REPORT OF THE SIXTY-SIXTH SESSION OF THE COMMITTEE ON CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL MATTERS (Rome, 5-6 May 1997)^27
Amendment to Rule XXXIII of the General Rules of the Organization and of the Rules of Procedure of the Committee on World Food Security ^28
86. The Council considered and adopted the Report of the Sixty-sixth Session of the CCLM.
87. The Council concurred with the proposed amendment to Rule XXXIII of the General Rules of the Organization and recommended that it be referred, together with the following draft Resolution, to the Conference at its Twenty-ninth Session in November 1997 for consideration and adoption:
Draft Resolution for the Conference
Amendments to Rule XXXIII of the General Rules of the Organization (Committee on World Food Security)
THE CONFERENCE,
Recalling
that Rule XXXIII of the General Rules of the Organization establishing the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) and its terms of reference was adopted by the Conference at its Eighteenth Session in November 1975 (Resolution 21/75),
Recalling
further that Commitment Seven of the Plan of Action adopted by the World Food Summit in November 1996 accorded a substantial role to the CFS in the monitoring of the implementation of the Plan of Action,
Considering
that the above-mentioned role should be reflected in the mandate of the CFS as set out in Rule XXXIII of the General Rules of the Organization (GRO),
Considering
that further changes to the wording of Rule XXXIII GRO are required in order to reflect the new responsibilities falling upon FAO as a result of the abolition of the World Food Council by the UN General Assembly,
Considering
also that further amendments are required in order to reflect changes in institutional organization in the UN system, such as the replacement of the Committee on Food Aid Policies and Programmes by the Executive Board of the World Food Programme, and to rationalize and modernize the terms of reference of the CFS in line with recent practice,
Decides
to amend Rule XXXIII of the General Rules of the Organization, Committee on World Food Security, as follows:

To this end, Governments, in partnership with all actors of civil society, in coordination with relevant international institutions and, in conformity with ECOSOC Resolution 1996/36 on the follow-up to the major international UN conferences and summits as appropriate, will:
(a) Establish through the CFS a timetable, procedures and standardized reporting formats, which do not duplicate similar reports to the UN, FAO and other agencies, on the national, sub-regional and regional implementation of the World Food Summit Plan of Action;
(b) Set out in the CFS a process for developing targets and verifiable indicators of national and global food security where they do not exist;
(c) Report to the CFS on national, sub-regional and regional implementation of the World Food Summit Plan of Action, drawing on a food insecurity and vulnerability information and mapping system, once established, as an analytical aid;
(d) Invite the Secretary-General of the UN to request the ACC to report to ECOSOC in accordance with established procedures progress on the follow-up by UN agencies to the World Food Summit;
(e) Monitor through the CFS the national, sub-regional, regional and international implementation of the World Food Summit Plan of Action, using reports from national governments, reports on UN agency follow-up and inter-agency coordination, and information from other relevant international institutions;
(f) Provide regular reports on implementation of the World Food Summit Plan of Action through the CFS via the FAO Council to the ECOSOC;
(g) Encourage the effective participation of relevant actors of civil society in the CFS monitoring process, recognizing their critical role in enhancing food security;
(h) By 2006, undertake in the CFS and within available resources a major broad-based progress assessment of the implementation of the World Food Summit Plan of Action and a mid-term review of achieving the target of reducing the number of undernourished people to half their present level no later than 2015. This progress assessment and review should be in the context of a special forum of a regular session of the CFS and involve active participation from governments, relevant international organizations and actors of civil society.

STATEMENT BY THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL
Mr Chairman of the Council,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is a great pleasure to welcome you to Rome for this Hundred and Twelfth Session of the Council. This is a particularly important session, not only because you will be providing the Organization with general guidelines for its activities over the next years and more specifically over the next biennium, but also because this is the first session of the Council after the World Food Summit. The commitments in the Summit Plan of Action and the important responsibilities assigned to FAO in the follow-up to the Summit have serious implications for the Summary Programme of Work and Budget.
Another focus of your deliberations will be the present state of food and agriculture, where recent trends are in some respects encouraging, although we must not lose sight of the enormity of the problems that remain to be resolved.
World production of staple foods rose appreciably in 1996, the highest rates of growth among the developing regions being those in Africa. Provisional estimates for 1997 suggest that this growth in food production will continue, not only for cereals, but also for the main oil crops, cassava, meat and milk products. World cereal production, which had reached record levels in 1996 after a worrying downturn, could reach comparable or even higher levels this year. Yet, for all their expected increase in 1997, world cereal stocks will probably remain below the security threshold of 17 to 18 percent of consumption.
At the same time, the present economic situation offers a more favourable climate for food security, with a modest increase in global production, particularly on the part of the developing counties, strong growth of international trade and a general fall in inflation and interest rates. Economic conditions in many of the low-income countries have been decidedly better in the last two years, particularly in Africa. We must now make sure that this improvement affects the purchasing power of the least privileged population groups and enhances their access to food.
The food situation however is still marked by strong regional and local disparities due to unfavourable weather, natural disasters or man-made crises. Since January 1996, through its Global Information and Early Warning System, FAO - often in tandem with the World Food Programme - has fielded over 40 missions to evaluate harvests and food supplies in the vulnerable and hardest-hit countries. These missions have helped drum up emergency aid for millions of victims. In one and a half years, I and the Executive Director of WFP have together approved 23 emergency operations, at a total value of some 860 million dollars, to provide assistance to 15 million beneficiaries. In Africa alone, 16 countries are currently facing exceptional food crises and the prevailing situation in the Great Lakes Region, in Iraq and in North Korea is cause for continuing concern.
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
The Committee on World Food Security was appointed by the Summit to monitor implementation of the Plan of Action and to track the progress being made towards achieving the minimum objective of halving the number of undernourished people in the world by the year 2015, at the latest. The Committee met in April and agreed to a provisional procedure of establishing reports for use in 1997 by governments, the United Nations agencies and other international organizations involved in the implementation of the Plan of Action. The Committee also examined the amendments to the General Rules of the Organization, which you will be looking at before these are submitted to the Conference.
The Administrative Committee on Co-ordination (ACC), which groups the executive heads of all the organizations in the UN system, is charged with ensuring inter-agency coordination in the follow-up to the Summit. The joint FAO/IFAD proposal on the modalities of such cooperation was approved at the last session of the ACC in April in Geneva.
FAO will therefore draft a report on the outcome and follow-up of the Summit for discussion by the Economic and Social Council prior to submission to the General Assembly.
Last March, FAO organized a Technical Consultation on the Food Insecurity and Vulnerability Information and Mapping System, which was attended by experts and representatives of all the UN agencies concerned, national institutions and NGOs. The outcome of this consultation has already been endorsed by the Committee on World Food Security and numerous actions have already been initiated to put the short-term components of the plan of work into effect.
The proposals in the Programme of Work and Budget 1998-99 also include a new interdisciplinary sub-programme which is aimed at consolidating and reinforcing information and mapping activities. This will help Member Nations develop and maintain a national system enabling them to rapidly and accurately identify population groups suffering from, or exposed to, malnutrition, to determine the underlying causes and to come up with remedial actions.
FAO conveyed the results of the Summit to the Commission on Human Rights and concluded an agreement with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to work closely on better defining the right to food as one of the basic human rights. The High Commissioner plans to convene a meeting of experts on this matter in July or August of this year.
The Organization was quick to engage in the preparation of national strategies, in close collabotation with member country experts, for agricultural development towards the year 2010, the objective being to take the commitments in the Plan of Action from global to country level and to foster cooperation with our development partners in their implementation. This exercise began with the low-income food-deficit countries and will subsequently be extended to the other developing countries, those in transition and to any developed country that may be interested. The resulting documents are first submitted to the UN system, the Bretton Woods Institutions and the regional development banks before being presented to the ministers of agriculture for broader consultation and formal government adoption.
However, one of the most important contributions expected from FAO for implementation of the Summit Plan of Action, particularly its Commitment 3, is of course in the area of agricultural development. In this connection, the Special Programme for Food Security in the low-income food-deficit countries, which was launched - with your agreement - well before the Summit, will continue as one of the central pillars of FAO's action in the field. After all, the 840 million people suffering from chronic undernourishment live mainly in the developing countries and in the countries in transition. Two years after it was introduced, the Special Programme is now operational in 18 of these countries and is either being launched or under formulation in seven others. The principles behind this programme are well known; it aims to increase food production and availability through the adoption of a multidisciplinary and participatory approach that is environmentally responsible and
socially equitable. The ultimate goal is of course to improve the living conditions of the poorest sectors of the rural population, particularly the women. The Special Programme belongs to all the Member Nations that wish to take part and to their farmers; FAO only intervenes upon the express request of governments, particularly for interventions financed by the Technical Cooperation Programme whose criteria are strictly applied.
However, the aims of the Rome Declaration are ambitious and require substantial resources. But at a time of budget stringencies for governments and international organizations everywhere, we need to be innovative in our search for the funds needed to implement the Summit Plan of Action. We have therefore cemented our ties with our development partners, the donor countries, the other UN agencies and programmes, the international and regional financial institutions, the decentralized institutions, the private sector, the non-governmental organizations and also the international and national research institutes.
As a result, I signed agreements in January this year with the Presidents of the World Bank and of the African Development Bank for the promotion of rural development and food security in Africa. Under these agreements, each bank has undertaken to look favourably upon requests from Member Nations for the funding of Special Programme pilot activities, up to a ceiling of 1.5 million dollars per country. In the same vein, discussions are at a very advanced stage with the Islamic Development Bank and should lead to the signature of a cooperation agreement on food security. Discussions are also underway with the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, IFAD and the World Food Programme for their participation in the Special Programme. Elsewhere, the International Food Policy Research Institute is the first member of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research to have decided to join the Programme, focusing especially on the social and
economic constraints. Finally, South-South cooperation agreements are gradually being put into place, with experienced technical experts from developing countries being sent to work alongside the beneficiary farmers of the Special Programme.
A number of parallel initiatives have also been launched to rally civil society and the decentralized institutions, and in so doing to build upon the momentum that was generated by the Summit, which saw the active participation of parliamentarians, non-governmental organizations and representatives of the private sector.
The slogan for this year's World Food Day, "Investing in Food Security", reflects this perspective of mobilization. The celebratory events include the TeleFood operation, a worldwide audio-visual programme designed, first, to hold the decisions taken at the Summit in the public eye and, second, to invoke the solidarity of all people concerned about the problem of hunger in the world.
Determined government action is vital to the success of this mobilization exercise which will have the draw upon all strands of state and society if the objectives of the Summit Plan of Action are to be achieved. In this connection, the Plan calls upon governments to launch national "Food for All" campaigns, marshalling all stakeholders and their resources for implementation of the intended measures. The first stage of these campaigns should be for Member Nations to set up a national forum comprising all development players and partners, particularly the private sector, non-governmental organizations, universities, research institutes, parliamentarians, women's and youth groups, the media and civil society.
It is encouraging to note that a number of developed and developing countries have already launched such campaigns. Other governments should follow suit and establish such forums. FAO will, of course, help them in any way needed.
Alongside all these efforts to round up and coordinate forces for the follow-up to the Summit, the Organization has also been pursuing its traditional normative activities, which remain as important as ever. Two examples where significant progress has been made in recent months are:
- The revision of the International Plant Protection Convention which allows countries to take measures to prevent the introduction and spread of pests and diseases, while at the same time ensuring that these are reasonable and do not constitute unfair barriers to trade. The revised text, the result of a lengthy process of consultation, is before you for finalization and submission to the Conference, as recommended by the Committee on Agriculture. At the same time, the Committee also recommended that the Council and Conference adopt new standards for the harmonization of plant protection measures.
- The Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture which has also held two sessions in six months, mainly to pursue negotiations on the revision of the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources so that this effectively mirrors the Convention on Biological Diversity. The revision should facilitate access to genetic resources, better define farmers' rights, ensure the conservation and sustainable utilization of genetic resources and provide for the equitable sharing of resulting benefits. This is a very complex area, but one in which substantial progress has been made and in which early agreement is feasible, on condition that the political will genuinely exists.
The review of the statutory bodies and panels of experts is also on your agenda. Acting upon the Council's recommendations for greater savings and efficiency in governance, the Programme and Finance Committees formulated guidelines for the conduct and organization of meetings and recommended changes in the calendars of Committees reporting to the Council in Conference years. The overriding idea is that they should contribute more fully towards shaping the Programme of Work and Budget. At their joint meeting in April, the Committees also examined the Secretariat's proposals on the subject of the review of the statutory bodies and panels of experts that had been initiated by the Council in November 1995.
In this connection, the role of the Secretariat is to provide information, highlight the issues and help reach conclusions. But this exercise falls essentially within the competence of the governing bodies. The Programme and Finance Committees in fact appointed a small working party, based in Rome and chaired by the Permanent Representative of Belgium, to look more closely at the recommendations in the Secretariat's document and to provide the Committees with further guidelines at their session in September 1997.
The Council will therefore be able to examine the Secretariat's proposals to complete the review process and bring about an effective streamlining of the statutory bodies and panels of experts. The main concern is to turn increasingly to ad hoc bodies with specific tasks and limited time frames rather than to establish statutory bodies that might, after a while, lose sight of their raison d'être.
Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen,
The most important item on your agenda is the Summary Programme of Work and Budget 1988-99. In accordance with the recommendations of the Joint Meeting of the Programme and Finance Committees in January, the Summary has been prepared on the basis of zero real growth, and supplemented by two further scenarios:
- a real growth option, reinstating the technical and economic programme cuts made in the 1996-97 budget. The Programme and Finance Committees had hoped that the corresponding sums could be restored in the subsequent biennium. This scenario implies an increase of US$ 11 million, all directed towards high priority normative work;
- a zero nominal growth option, which would require us to hold the budget at US$ 650 million, despite cost increases of US$ 39 million. This would entail programme cuts.
This latter option has been addressed in strict compliance with the Council's criteria for the identification of activities to be cut. The reductions have therefore been concentrated as far as possible in the administrative areas, but without of course being able to repeat the excellent results of the 1996-97 biennium, when 70 percent of the required savings of US$ 57 million were found from gains in efficiency or cuts in the non-technical chapters of the budget.
The preparation of a zero nominal growth budget is underway, with every effort being made to minimize damage to our programmes, mainly by following the advice of the Programme and Finance Committees on cost increases and the impact of the exchange rate.
The issue of After Service Medical Coverage needs careful attention. Any agreed move to adopt accepted accounting practices on this matter and fund the actuarial deficit that has accumulated over the last 30 years cannot possibly be at the expense of the Organization's technical programmes. Solutions to this problem need to be explored, for instance by spreading the cost over several biennia, as and when contributions arrears are made available.
The Programme and Finance Committees also asked me to identify activities that would be eliminated if the budget were below the zero nominal level.
We need at this point to query the principle of applying blanket zero nominal growth in 1998/99 to all the specialized agencies. Also, consideration should surely be given to the impact of each agency's respective budgetary situation in 1996/97 - some had to take heavy cuts as compared to the 1994-95 biennium and implement painful reductions in personnel, while others experienced a distinct improvement in funding over the same period. Consideration should also be given to the fact that the exchange rate impacts differently, depending on whether an agency's budget is expressed in dollars or in the local currency.
For FAO, the zero nominal growth budget would mean a reduction close to 6 percent before adjustment for the rate of exchange between the dollar and the lira, and about 4.3 percent at the present rate. The Council should therefore carefully consider the implications of such an option for the Organization's capacity to implement the recommendations of the technical committees and the decisions of the World Food Summit.
The Council's agenda is thus particularly full and includes some difficult issues. However, the Secretariat must receive the clear guidelines it needs, in particular to finalize the Programme of Work and Budget for the next biennium.
I wish you every success in your work and hope that the representatives of Member Nations and observers have a pleasant stay in Rome.
Thank you for your kind attention.

1. The Commission, at its Twenty-fifth Session, adopted several ammendments proposed by the APFIC Executive Committee at its Sixty-sixth Session. Words in square brackets are deleted and words underlined are added to the current texts of the Agreement and Rules of Procedure.
2. The CCLM, at its 66th Session (May 1997), gave very careful consideration to the proposed amendment to Rule XVI of the Rules of Procedure of APFIC by which, in future, only the English language would be the official language of the Commission. The CCLM agreed that, from a strictly legal point of view, the amendment was not contrary to the Basic Texts of the Organization. Nevertheless, it was of the opinion that the best solution would be to recommend that the official languages remain English and French with the possibility for the Commission to decide on the working language or languages to be used at each of its sessions.
